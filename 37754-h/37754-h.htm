<h2>EDITOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>The author of this volume was born at Vernon,
Connecticut, on March 12, 1838, of a long line of
New England ancestry; he was sixth in order of
descent from Governor Thomas Hinkley of Plymouth
Colony. Coming to Wisconsin in his eleventh
year, Julian grew to young manhood on his
father's farm at Waupun and in Portage County.
In 1858, our author left the farm and started life
for himself&mdash;teaching school in winter, and working
as a carpenter each summer.</p>

<p>On April 19, 1861, Mr. Hinkley enlisted in the
Waupun Light Guard for three months. But the
services of the organization were not accepted for
that short term by the State military authorities, so
on May 8 they were proffered and accepted for the
war, and the organization became Company E of
the Third Wisconsin Infantry. Hinkley was at
the organization appointed First-Sergeant; but on
February 6, 1862, he was commissioned Second-Lieutenant
of his company, became First-Lieutenant
on November 1 following, and on May 4,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
1863, took command of the Company as Captain.
He continued to serve the Third Wisconsin until
its final discharge and payment in Madison on August
26, 1865, but during the last few months of
this period was the acting Major of the Regiment.
Since the war, Major Hinkley has been largely
engaged in erecting public buildings, and has a
wide acquaintance throughout Northeast Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The Commission is much pleased at this opportunity
to publish Major Hinkley's <i>Narrative</i>.
The book has only in part been written from memory.
It has been made up from several excellent
sources: (1) A manuscript diary kept from day
to day, or week to week, by Mr. Hinkley during
the years of his service; (2) several contemporary
letters written by him, either to the local press of
his section of the State, or to relatives and friends at
home; and lastly (3), a manuscript narrative written
by the author several years after the war, for
the edification of his children. The work of amalgamating
these diverse materials has fallen to the
lot of the editorial department of the Commission;
the result, however, has been passed upon in detail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
by Major Hinkley, and in its present continuous
form accepted by him as his final narrative. This
method of compilation has secured a manuscript
possessing a contemporaneous flavor and accuracy,
not usual with reminiscences. The Commissioners
feel that the book is an interesting and valuable
contribution to the literature of the war, being the
view-point of a company commander in one of the
most active of Wisconsin regiments, throughout
the entire period of the struggle.</p>

<h2><i>Enlistment and Training</i></h2>


<p>The presidential election of 1860 found me
just become of age. I exercised my newly-acquired
rights of citizenship, in the then little village
of Waupun, Wisconsin, by participating in the
hurrahing and torchlight processions that in those
days characterized a political campaign. I was
a carpenter by trade, but immediately after the
election went to teach a country school in the
backwoods town of Buena Vista, in Portage
County. Daily papers in that sparsely settled
community were of course an unknown luxury,
and it was only through the weeklies that we
heard of the gathering storm in the Nation. From
them we learned how State after State in the
South were holding conventions, that they were
passing ordinances of secession, and that the delegates
were gathering at Montgomery, Alabama,
to organize the Confederate States of America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>In the North, few people seemed as yet to
realize that a great war was impending. The
Southern newspapers boastfully asserted that secession
might be accomplished in peace, for the
Northerners were a nation of shopkeepers and
mechanics, who would never fight to prevent it.
And these statements, reprinted in the Northern
papers, were far from soothing, for there is nothing
that so quickly arouses the combativeness of men,
and especially of young men, as the intimation
that they are cowards. Thus were the younger
and more hot-headed men on both sides being
stirred to warlike feeling by newspaper writers,
until such hostile sentiment was aroused that war
was inevitable.</p>

<p>Immediately after the secession of South Carolina,
I had expressed my intention, in conversation
with my friends, that should war follow, I
would have a hand in it. This determination
grew as events drifted on from bad to worse. I
cannot say that I was very strongly animated by a
love for the Union in the abstract, or that I considered
the abolition of slavery worth fighting for;
but I felt that the dismemberment of the Union by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
armed force, submitted to without a struggle,
would be a disgrace to the whole North.</p>

<p>The events of the following winter and spring
are a part of the history of the Nation. Abraham
Lincoln was inaugurated on March 4, 1861. On
April 12, Fort Sumter was fired upon, and surrendered
on the 14th. On April 15 Lincoln issued
his call for troops, and the war had burst
upon the Nation in all its fury.</p>

<p>Waupun for a number of years maintained
an independent military company, called the
Waupun Light Guard. This organization had
in its possession forty stand of arms belonging to
the State, and uniforms for about twenty of its
members. On the morning of April 19, I had
gone down to the main street of the village to buy
a paper. While discussing with Captain Clark
of the military company, the events of the day, an
agent of the State, who had just arrived on the
morning train, approached us. He read to the
Captain a notice that his company must at once be
filled up to the regulation standard and reported
for active duty, or surrender its arms, to be used by
other companies going into service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>I had not heretofore belonged to this company,
but at once told the Captain that I would enlist,
and aid him to fill his command to the required
standard. A meeting was called for that night,
and with the assistance of the patriotic people of
the village and surrounding country, the company
was filled up by nine o'clock of the next morning.
A telegram was immediately sent to Madison,
tendering service for the ninety-day call. We had
acted promptly and swiftly, yet not quite swiftly
enough. Twenty-three other companies had filed
notice before us, and the quota of Wisconsin was
full.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm among the men ran high, however,
and when on May 8 it was learned that no more
ninety-day men could be accepted, it was determined
by vote to tender service for the entire war,
however long that might be. Those whose business
was such that they could not leave home for
longer than ninety days retired, but their places
were quickly taken by others who were anxious to
go. We were now accepted, and assigned to the
Third Wisconsin Volunteers and ordered to rendevouz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
at Fond du Lac as soon as camp equipage
could be furnished.</p>

<p>The former officers of the company were retained,
with the consent of the newly-enlisted men,
and additional non-commissioned officers were
elected. Among the latter I was chosen First
Sergeant, which position I held until promoted
to a Second-Lieutenancy.</p>

<p>We boarded at the best hotels in the village,
until ordered into camp. We were drilled several
hours each day, and prepared for the work in store
for us by the study of tactics and army regulations.
At length, after what seemed to us in our impatience
an interminable delay, we went into
camp at Fond du Lac on June 15, and for the first
time lived in tents. We now had daily company
and battalion drill, together with officers' school in
tactics and sword exercise. Colonel Thomas H.
Ruger, our commander, was a West Point graduate,
and under his efficient direction we became,
before we had been very long in the service, as
thoroughly drilled and disciplined as any regiment
of regulars. Indeed we all felt sure, while we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
were still at Fond du Lac, that we were already
veterans.</p>

<p>On June 28 appeared Captain McIntyre of the
regular army to inspect us and muster us into the
service of the United States. And here occurred a
difficulty which illustrates how confidently the
people of the North expected that the war would
be of only short duration. Many of the best men
in the company, who had been entirely willing to
enlist "for the war," objected to being mustered
in for a three-years' term of service as required by
the instructions of the Federal Government. It was
only after considerable persuasion that they were
all finally induced to do so. Probably not one of
them had the slightest idea that he would serve for
three years, and then enlist again for another three
years, before the great struggle would be ended.</p>

<p>On the day after mustering in, uniforms were
issued to us, consisting of light-grey trousers,
mixed-grey blouse, and light-coloured hat. At
first, they looked bright and fine, but they were of
such poor quality, especially the trousers, that
within ten days it was necessary to furnish the entire
regiment with common blue workingmen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
overalls, in order that we might with decency be
seen upon the streets. Some money-loving patriot
contractor had gathered in his reward from the
State of Wisconsin by providing us with shoddy
clothes; and in the end it came out of the pay of
the Regiment.</p>

<h2><i>Departure for the Front</i></h2>


<p>The preparations for departure were soon completed,
and on July 12, 1861, we shouldered our
knapsacks, strapped on our haversacks, containing
several days' rations, and boarded the railroad
cars for the seat of war in Virginia. The train of
twenty-four coaches pulled out of the station amid
the cheers and farewells of our many friends, who
had gathered to see us off. All were in the best of
spirits. It seemed to us as though we were setting
out on a grand pleasure excursion. No thought of
death or disaster appeared to cross the mind of
anyone. And yet how many were saying farewell,
never to return!</p>

<p>Our route took us through Chicago, Toledo,
Cleveland, and Erie. Everywhere we were
feasted and toasted by the enthusiastic people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
along the line. At Buffalo the entire population
seemed to have turned out to welcome the wild
woodsmen of the Northwest. The local military
companies of that city escorted us through the principal
streets; speeches were made by the mayor
and prominent citizens. We were very soon convinced
that we were, indeed, heroes in embryo.
At Williamsport, Pennsylvania, we were given
a reception surpassing anything that had gone
before; even now, more than fifty years after, its
pleasant recollections still linger in my mind.
Tables were set along the sidewalk in the shade
of magnificent trees, and these tables were literally
loaded with all the good things that could tempt
an epicure. There were, besides, fair ladies without
number to welcome us, and wait upon our
needs.</p>

<p>On July 16 we reached Hagerstown, Maryland,
where we went into camp, and where on the
next day we were equipped with a complete outfit
of muskets, ammunition, and camp utensils. The
degree of preparation of the Federal Government
for war at this time, may be judged from the fact
that the muskets issued to us were old-time smooth-bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Springfields, that had been rifled for a minie-ball;
they were so light, that their barrels would
spring after the rapid firing of a dozen shots.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>Service in Maryland</i></h2>


<p>On the morning of July 17 we broke camp and
started for Harpers Ferry, thirty miles distant.
Now for the first time I began to realize what it
was to be a soldier. I carried a knapsack laden
with the various things that kind friends at home
had thought necessary for a soldier's comfort, a
haversack containing two days' rations, a musket
with accoutrements, and forty rounds of ammunition,
altogether weighing not less than fifty
pounds. The weather was extremely hot and the
roads very muddy, so that by the time we had gone
fifteen miles I was entirely ready to go into camp.</p>

<p>Our camp was pitched on the side of a hill.
Our mess, in order to find as level a sleeping place
as possible, pitched the tent in a low place, and in
our ignorance of camp life we neglected to dig a
ditch around it. A sudden shower came up soon
after we had gone to sleep, and in a short time we
found ourselves lying in a pool of water. And as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
if this were not misfortune enough, our tent pins,
loosened by the soaking of the ground, suddenly
pulled out, and down came our canvas shelter.
Subsequent experience enabled me to sleep in wet
blankets, or in no blankets at all, just as well as
in the best bed; but at this time it was impossible.
So gathering a rubber blanket around my shoulders,
I found a large stone, and remained upon it
for the rest of the night. In the morning we continued
the march toward Harpers Ferry. Our
camp for the next night was pitched on a bit of
comparatively level ground on the east side of
Maryland Heights, overlooking the little village
of Sandy Hook, and about a mile distant from
Harpers Ferry. A more thoroughly used-up lot
of men than ours that night, it would be hard to
find.</p>

<p>My first military duty was to guard the ford at
Harpers Ferry and the bridges across the canal.
The region was historic ground, and I took this
opportunity to visit the old arsenal, then in ruins,
and the old engine-house where John Brown had
battled so bravely for his life. I made it a point
also to visit Jefferson's Rock, the view from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Jefferson, in his <i>Notes on Virginia</i>, says is worth a
voyage across the Atlantic to see.</p>

<p>On September 15, while encamped in the vicinity
of Darnestown, we were ordered, late in the
day, to break camp and take the road toward the
west. Our destination was not disclosed to us,
and there was a great deal of speculation among
the men as to the object of this secret and hurried
march. The next day we found out from citizens
along the road that we were on the way to Frederick
City, the capital of Maryland. We arrived
there late on the afternoon of the 16th, and received
an enthusiastic welcome from the citizens
of that loyal town. Early the next morning, guards
were stationed on all roads leading out of town,
and detachments of men, accompanied by detectives,
proceeded to arrest the members of the
Maryland Legislature, who had assembled there
for the purpose of passing an ordinance of secession.
It was thus that Maryland was saved to the
Union by the promptness of General McClellan.
Her secessionist legislators found themselves,
shortly after, assembled at Fort McHenry, with
leisure to meditate upon their schemes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>The Regiment remained in camp at Frederick
City until late in October. The usual monotony
of camp life, with its drills, dress parades, and
guard mountings, was broken only by the arrival
of the paymaster with crisp new greenbacks of the
first issue, and by the appearance of new blue uniforms
in exchange for our tattered array. To the
old grey we bade adieu without a sigh of regret,
and proudly donned the blue of United States
soldiers.</p>

<p>One interesting incident occurred during our
stay here, which gave us a subject for discussion
for several days. News had been brought to us of
a large quantity of wheat, stored in a mill in Harpers
Ferry, which was about to be ground into
flour for the use of the Confederate army. An
expedition to capture it was soon organized under
command of Colonel John W. Geary of the
Twenty-Eighth Pennsylvania. It was composed
of a detachment of two hundred men from our regiment
under command of Captain Bertram, with
similar detachments from the Twelfth Massachusetts
and Twenty-Eighth Pennsylvania, besides a
section of artillery. The expedition was successful;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the wheat was safely removed to the north
side of the river, and the command was ready to
return, when a large force of the enemy appeared,
seemingly disposed for a fight. Our men were
quite willing to accommodate them, and moved
up the hill toward Bolivar Heights, where the
enemy was already strongly posted with artillery.
Skirmishing immediately commenced. But this
soon proved too slow for our impatient men; they
charged the Confederate position, and soon had
the satisfaction of seeing the last of the Southerners
disappear in the direction of Charlestown,
leaving their artillery in our hands.</p>

<p>In this engagement the heaviest fighting fell to
the detachment of the Third Wisconsin; the piece
of artillery was brought off by them as a trophy.
This command also sustained all of the loss, having
had six men killed and four wounded. The
dead were brought back and buried with military
honors in the cemetery at Frederick City. The
fight had in a large measure been unnecessary, for
the entire object of the expedition had been accomplished
before the enemy appeared in force; yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the moral effect on the men was good, since it
increased their self-confidence.</p>

<p>On November 1 we rejoined the Division of
General Banks, near Darnestown, where we remained
until the beginning of the next month.
The whole Division then moved to the vicinity of
Frederick City, our Regiment being detailed in the
city as provost guard. We built our barracks in
the old barrack yard, and settled down for the
winter to the regular routine of guard duty. Two
companies were detailed each day&mdash;one for the
guard-house, the other to patrol the city and preserve
order. The snow, rain, and mud kept the
ground in such condition that drilling was impossible;
thus we had little to do but kill time with
chess, checkers, cards, and dominoes. The winter
wore slowly away in this uneventful manner. In
January news was received of the victory of General
Thomas at Somerset, Kentucky; also the capture
of Roanoke Island, by General Burnside, and
immediately after this, in February, the great victories
of General Grant at Forts Henry and Donelson.
The enthusiasm of the command over these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
successes knew no bounds, and our impatience to
be on the move could scarcely be restrained.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>On the trail of Stonewall Jackson</i></h2>


<p>At length the long-wished-for came. On the
morning of February 25, 1862, we bade adieu to
the barracks that had sheltered us so long, and
boarding the cars moved to Sandy Hook, where
we went into camp on the ground that we had left
six months before. During the night there arrived
a train of cars with a pontoon bridge, in charge of
a detachment of United States engineers; and
General McClellan came from Washington by
special train, personally to supervise the movement.
Our Regiment being largely composed of lumbermen
and raftsmen from northern Wisconsin, who
were accustomed to running rafts on the rivers of
our State, readily made up a detail of a hundred
experienced fellows to assist the engineers in laying
the bridge. By noon it was constructed, 1300
feet long, in a swift current and our Regiment, the
advance of the army, was on its way into Dixie.</p>

<p>We moved rapidly on to Bolivar Heights without
seeing anything of the enemy, and halted there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
for the night, happy in the thought that at last we
were doing something. On February 28 a strong
reconnoitering party of infantry, artillery, and cavalry,
moved forward, and without opposition occupied
Charlestown. It was a village of national
reputation at that time, for there John Brown was
tried and hung. It was one of the hottest secessionist
spots in the State, any Union sentiment that
might have existed, being carefully concealed.
We remained there for several days quartered in
the various churches and public buildings, while I
improved the opportunity to visit the many points
of interest. On March 2 came my commission as
Second Lieutenant of Company D.</p>

<p>On March 11 we once more moved forward in
the direction of Winchester, the advance guard
skirmishing with the enemy occasionally, but meeting
no serious resistance. The next morning we
turned out at four o'clock, and advancing through
fields and woods for about an hour, came at length
in sight of the entrenchments of Winchester, about
a mile to the front. Our right and left companies
were thrown forward as skirmishers, in preparation
for a fight, but met with no resistance, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
soon clambering over the parapet of the deserted
fort. They pushed on into the town, the remainder
of the Regiment following closely after, and received
from the mayor the formal surrender of the
municipality. It was the first surrender of this interesting
city, which is said to have been captured
and recaptured more than thirty times during the
war. We found here an apparently strong Union
sentiment. As our Regiment marched in with
colors flying and band playing, the citizens were
rejoicing everywhere over their deliverance from
the Confederates. Innumerable handkerchiefs
were waving to welcome us, and in some instances
the stars and stripes were displayed. We
learned from citizens that General Stonewall
Jackson had with 6,000 men, retreated the night
before toward Strasburgh, taking with him quite
a number of the Union citizens of the town.</p>

<p>We now went into camp a short distance south
of Winchester, where we remained until March
22. Continually we were hearing of the glorious
successes of the Western Army, and becoming
more and more anxious that our Army of the Potomac
should be given an opportunity to rival its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
achievements. A number of changes in the organization
of the Division were made while we were
here in camp. The only one of importance to us
was the transfer of the Second Massachusetts to
our Brigade in place of the Ninth New York, giving
us Colonel Gordon of the Second Massachusetts
as brigade commander in place of General
Hamilton, our old leader. This circumstance was
little liked at the time; but it was the beginning of
our friendship with the Second Massachusetts,
that remained very close throughout the war.</p>

<p>On March 22 our Division left Winchester to
proceed, as we believed, to Manassas Junction. At
the end of a two days' march we were camping
for the night about three miles east of Snicker's
Gap, in the Blue Ridge. Rumors here began to
circulate, that there had in our absence been considerable
fighting at Winchester. It was reported
that the Confederates had been defeated, but that
General Shields had been wounded in the battle.
We were not, therefore, surprised, the next morning,
to be ordered to march back over the identical
road upon which we had come. We reached
Winchester the same night after a hard march of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
twenty-five miles, and learned from its citizens
that there certainly had been a fight. We were
informed that General Jackson had learned of our
departure from Winchester, but had not heard that
Shields was still encamped north of the city.
Jackson had made a hasty move to recapture Winchester,
but had been confronted by Shields near
Kernstown. Here the Confederates had been
completely routed and driven beyond Strasburgh,
with heavy loss in killed and prisoners.</p>

<p>On the morning after our arrival at Winchester,
I went out to take a view of the battle-field, and
was able to gain some idea of what the future held
in store for us. The wounded had already been
cared for, and some of the dead had been buried;
but sixteen of our dead remained on the field, and
something over three hundred of the enemy's. In
one part of the battle-ground, covered with small
timber and underbrush, where the enemy had for
a time made a stubborn resistance, scarcely a bush
or a tree but showed the marks of bullets at a
height of from three to six feet from the ground.
In my inexperience, I then wondered how any man
could have lived in that thicket; and in truth, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
many did live there long, for the ground was
strewn with the dead.</p>

<p>Returning to camp at noon, I found that we
were again under orders to march. We started
out near sundown, moving that night to Strasburgh,
and found the bridge over Cedar Creek, two miles
this side of Strasburgh, destroyed. It had been
burned by Jackson at the time of his first retreat
from Winchester. This precaution had in the recent
fight proved to be his undoing, for in his hasty
flight before Shield's Division, his army, which
up to that place had preserved good order, was
completely disorganized and suffered a loss of two
hundred prisoners.</p>

<p>We remained at Strasburgh for several days.
During that time I was detailed on a general court
martial to try some soldiers who had been arrested
for depredations on private property. Their offence,
as I was informed, consisted in stealing
chickens and honey, against which stringent orders
were at that time in force. The court convened in
all dignity, and sent word to the General that it
was ready to try the culprits. In a few minutes
Adjutant Wilkins appeared, presented the compliments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of the General and informed us that the
prisoners had escaped. We were requested to adjourn
until they had been recaptured. As that
court was never reconvened, it may be taken for
granted that the prisoners were never recaptured.</p>

<p>On the first day of April we again moved forward,
driving the enemy in such haste that they
left their dinners cooking on the fires. Several
times during the day, they opened on us with artillery,
but a few shots from our battery would
quickly send them on again. On the 17th we
made another attempt to get at Jackson's army,
by moving one Division up the Shenandoah River
on the west side, and the other into New Market
from the southwest. Our Regiment was with the
latter Division. After fording a river up to our
armpits, and finding it as cold as melting snow
from the mountains could make it, we found that
the enemy had again shown his heels and once
more was away to the south.</p>

<p>During the next month we followed the retreating
army of General Jackson to Harrisonburg,
and then came back to Strasburgh. Here we
made some little show of fortifying; but in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
main, we were as easy and unconcerned as though
the war was over. And in fact, the good news
received from all quarters, and the orders from the
War Department to stop all recruiting, led us to
believe that the contest was nearly ended. In
camp, bets were freely offered, with no takers,
that the Regiment would be back in Wisconsin by
September. I remember writing to a friend, about
this time, that my part of the work of suppressing
the Rebellion seemed to be about done. How
sadly were we mistaken!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>The Tables Turned</i></h2>


<p>We had a rude awakening from our dream of
peace. While we had been idling in fancied security,
General Jackson had gathered a large force
with which to overwhelm us. Our first intimation
of trouble came on the night of May 23, when we
were hastily called to defend our railroad bridge
toward Front Royal against the attack of the enemy.
The next day we were in full retreat toward
Winchester.</p>

<p>When about half way to Winchester, the enemy,
who had crossed from Front Royal, attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
our train in the front. The Fifth Connecticut and
Twenty-Eighth New York were hurried forward,
with the rest of the command following, and the
road was soon cleared. But this had hardly been
accomplished, when the enemy attacked in the
rear, and cut off about fifty wagons. At this new
danger a halt was called, and with two regiments
and a battery, General Banks hastened to the rear.
The lost wagons were recovered, but the animals
having all been driven off or killed, it was necessary
to burn the vehicles. Among the wagons
destroyed was one containing all the rations and
cooking utensils of my Company. We succeeded
at night in securing a few crackers from some of
the more fortunate companies, but most of my men
went supperless to bed. Moreover, there were
prospects for a lively fight in the morning.</p>

<p>I was awakened early by the picket-firing,
which commenced at daybreak, and found myself
thoroughly chilled from sleeping on the bare
ground, without blankets or shelter. However,
both hunger and cold were soon forgotten in the
more pressing demands upon our attention. The
position chosen by General Banks for the night's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
bivouac was probably the worst that could have
been found between Strasburgh and the Potomac
River. With seven regiments of infantry we occupied
a small field lying between the outskirts of
the city and the hills on the south. The enemy
were in possession of the hills, where they had
erected considerable fortifications. Colonel
Gordon's Brigade was on the right of the road;
that of Colonel Donnelly was on the left&mdash;all facing
the enemy.</p>

<p>Our skirmishers were promptly advanced, and
commenced firing on the enemy in their entrenchments.
Supported by a battery in our rear, which
fired over our heads into their position, we were
maintaining a lively fire, when suddenly it was
discovered that the enemy was passing around
upon our right, with the evident intention of getting
in our rear. The Twenty-Seventh Indiana and
Twenty-Ninth Pennsylvania were hurriedly
moved to the right, but had hardly reached their
position when they were furiously assailed both
in front and flank by the advancing Confederates.
The Twenty-Ninth Pennsylvania received the first
brunt of the attack, and soon was in full retreat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
The Twenty-Seventh Indiana came in for the
next attack, and they also fell back about a quarter
of a mile to some stone walls on the outskirts of
the city. Our Regiment and the Second Massachusetts,
which as yet had scarcely been engaged,
were now faced about and marched to the rear,
until we reached the fenced lots on the outskirts of
the town. Here we were halted, and opened fire
on the enemy, who had appeared in large numbers
upon our front.</p>

<p>We had soon checked the Confederates immediately
before us. I was looking around to see
how things were going with the others, when I became
aware that Company F and a portion of my
Company were entirely alone. It appears that
orders had been sent around by General Banks to
fall back to the north side of the city; but we, being
separated from the rest of the Regiment by an
intervening street, had not heard them. There we
were, fighting the whole Southern army by ourselves!
I hastened to Captain Limbocker to call his
attention to our position. He saw the situation at a
glance, and left-facing the companies, marched
double-quick through the back streets toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
main road of the city. By this time our men had
discovered that they were in a close place, and
moved rapidly. Just as we reached the main street
and turned north, I stopped to speak to the Captain,
who was in the rear. As I did so, I saw that
the whole street behind us to the south was swarming
with Confederate soldiers, not fifty feet away.
They were in such confusion, however, that it was
impossible for them to fire, and in fact they did not
seem to try. From that point until we were clear
of the street, it was simply a foot race, in which we
were the winners. They evidently soon tired of
the race, for before we were clear of the street they
had some artillery in position, and shot and shell
were flying harmlessly over our heads.</p>

<p>We afterwards learned that Colonel Donnelly's
Brigade, which at the beginning of the
fight had been posted out of our sight on the left
of the road, had also, like our Brigade, been assailed
in front and in the flank; and that they also,
had soon been forced back in full retreat.</p>

<p>We rejoined our Regiment in the line, without
further trouble. From our position we could see
the enemy on the hills west of us, endeavoring by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
rapid marching to reach the road in our rear. We
stopped only long enough to gather up our men,
who had become scattered in coming through the
streets of the city, and then moved on toward
Martinsburg. We did no more fighting and no
more running. All of General Banks's command
was ahead of us except two sections of artillery,
and detachments of the First Vermont and First
Michigan Cavalry, which protected our rear and
kept the enemy at a respectful distance. During
the retreat, General Banks did all that lay in the
power of any man to bring off his men without
loss, giving personal attention to the posting of the
rear guard.</p>

<p>I suppose it was about eight o'clock in the morning
when our Regiment began its march to Martinsburg,
twenty-three miles distant. We arrived
there at about five in the afternoon, without having
stopped for dinner, and without rest. Indeed,
we had no dinner to stop for, and the pursuing
enemy were not inclined to let us rest. We expected
to stop at Martinsburg, but General Banks
did not deem it safe, so after a rest of a half hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
we were ordered to proceed to Williamsport,
Maryland, twelve miles farther on.</p>

<p>We arrived at the Potomac, opposite Williamsport,
about ten o'clock that night, tired, hungry,
and in no very good humor over the results of our
two days' work. We managed to secure some
salt pork and a few crackers for supper, after
which we wrapped ourselves in our overcoats, and
took such rest as could be obtained, amid the noise
of men and teams crossing the ferry, and the calls
of stragglers who were coming in and seeking their
regiments. At three o'clock in the morning we
were aroused, and ordered to the ferry. About
an hour later we were across the Potomac on the
Maryland side, drawn up in line of battle and
waiting for the enemy.</p>

<p>General Banks was untiring in his efforts to
bring our train over safely, even riding into the
water to save mules that had lost their footing, and
were in danger of drowning. He made a speech
to the men, telling them that the enemy had advanced
no farther than Martinsburg, and that
20,000 men had been sent to cut off their retreat.</p>

<p>The roll call taken at this time showed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
eleven men of Company D were missing. Four of
these came in the next day, having taken a different
route than ours through the mountains.
Four others turned up in Libby prison. Most of
our men had thrown away their knapsacks, some
their haversacks and canteens, and sixteen had lost
their guns.</p>

<p>We remained at Williamsport until June 10,
receiving new supplies of camp and garrison equipage
to replace those that had been lost or destroyed.</p>

<p>We were rejoiced during this time to hear that
the Confederates had had the tables turned on
them; that they were being severely pressed between
Shields's and Frmont's armies; and that
all the baggage and prisoners that they had captured
from us had been retaken, with a good deal
more besides.</p>

<p>On the morning of June 10 we again crossed
into Virginia, and marched to Front Royal without
interruption. We passed through Winchester
on the 12th without stopping, however, for the
General seemed to fear that our men would burn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the town in return for the treachery of its citizens
during our retreat. Both men and women had
fired on us from the windows, and had poured
down scalding water as we passed through the
streets. It was even reported to us that women
had entered the hospitals, and shot sick men in
their beds; but this last was later contradicted.</p>

<p>We remained at Front Royal until July 6, during
which time important changes were made in
commanding officers. All the troops in northern
and western Virginia were united under General
John Pope&mdash;the three army corps being commanded
by McDowell, Sigel, and Banks. A
movement was made to concentrate the three corps
in one locality east of the Blue Ridge, in the accomplishment
of which we were marched over the
mountains at Chester Gap on the hottest day I ever
experienced. Eight men of my company were sun-struck
that afternoon, resulting fatally in one case,
and in permanent disability in the others. We
camped at night on the headwaters of the Rappahannock,
in a country described as naturally poor,
and entirely ruined by cultivation. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
one exception to this, however, in the abundance
of fruit. There were cherries and blackberries in
plenty for everybody.</p>

<p>While in camp near Little Washington, the unfortunate,
bombastic orders of General Pope were
published to the army; unfortunate, because they
incited a degree of contempt for him which
greatly impaired his usefulness. Many of his
highflown phrases, such as "shame and disaster
lurking in the rear," afforded a fine opportunity
for the wits of the army, when, not three weeks
later, his headquarters wagon and his personal
baggage were captured by the enemy. About
the first of August he arrived at the front, and on
the next Sunday reviewed General Banks's corps.
Pope's fine appearance, soldierly bearing, and evident
knowledge of his business did much to inspire
respect, and might even have made him
popular, if we could only have forgotten that fool
address to the army. He inaugurated, also, many
real reforms. I don't know whether he was entirely
responsible for it; but under his command
the cavalry began to be of real service to the army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and the men could no longer ask, "Who ever saw
a dead cavalryman?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>At Cedar Mountain</i></h2>


<p>On August 7 we broke camp again and
marched to Culpeper Court House. Here we
learned that the enemy had been seen in considerable
force near Cedar Mountain. We were not
surprised, therefore, on the morning after our arrival,
to be hastily formed and ordered off toward
Cedar Mountain. We arrived at Cedar Run in
the early afternoon, and found Crawford's
Brigade of our Division already skirmishing with
the enemy. Our Brigade immediately formed in
line of battle on the right of the road, and threw
out its skirmish line. At about four o'clock, my
Company and four others were moved forward to
renforce the skirmishers.</p>

<p>We had crossed Cedar Run Creek, and were
waiting for further orders in a heavy stand of timber,
when Captain Wilkins of General Williams's
staff rode up, enquiring for General Banks. Lieutenant-Colonel
Crane informed him that we had
seen nothing of General Banks since we entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the woods. Captain Wilkins then explained to us
that General Augur was meeting with considerable
success on the left, and that General Crawford
desired our Brigade to join his in a charge
upon the right. The movement required the sanction
of General Banks, who was, however, nowhere
to be found, and time was so pressing that
he almost felt justified in giving the order himself,
as coming from General Banks. Captain Wilkins
then turned and rode off, but had not been gone two
minutes, and had not, I am confident, seen General
Banks, when he returned, and gave Colonel Ruger
orders to assemble the Regiment on the right of
Crawford's Brigade and charge the enemy's lines.</p>

<p>Our skirmish line was now called in; we
formed in line of battle, and marched through the
woods as rapidly as the nature of the ground
would permit. We had soon come to its edge,
and found before us an open field about a hundred
and twenty-five yards across, separated from us
by a rail fence. Immediately beyond the field,
rose the thickly-timbered slope of the mountain;
and there too, stationed directly in our front, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
a battery of artillery. Of infantry, there were
none to be seen.</p>

<p>We hurried forward, pushed down the fence,
and without stopping to reform our line started on
a run for that battery. I noticed as we went, that
Crawford's Brigade had not yet arrived, and that
we were alone in the field. Suddenly, from the
side of the slope and from the bushes and rocks on
our front, arose the Confederate infantry, and
poured into our ranks the most destructive musketry
fire that I have ever experienced. Lieutenant-Colonel
Crane was killed, and fell from his horse
at the first volley. Major Scott was wounded,
being carried off by his horse. Captain Hawley,
of the company on our right, was wounded, and a
third of his men were killed or wounded at the
same time. The right began to fall back, some of
the men helping off wounded comrades, others
loading and firing at the enemy as they slowly retreated
to the woods. On the left, all three of my
companies were standing up to their work without
flinching. My Company, though suffering severely,
were fighting like veterans. We did not
seem to be gaining any advantage, however, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
shortly the order came to fall back to the woods.
My Company, and that of Captain O'Brien on the
left, were the last to leave the field.</p>

<p>Under the shelter of the woods we reformed our
companies. I still had about twenty-five men,
Captain O'Brien about as many more, and a number
of men from Company F had joined me on the
right. We at once returned to the edge of the
woods, the Colonel leading back the two left companies,
and opened fire on the enemy, who was
preparing to cross the open field. We soon were
sent to the right, however, in order to make room
for the Tenth Maine, and saw no more active
fighting for that day. At twilight, when we were
threatened upon our right flank, we returned across
Cedar Run to the ground from which we had
started.</p>

<p>Of the 8,000 men that were engaged in this
battle, we lost about 2,000 in killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The loss in our Regiment was 117, mostly from
the six companies that started in the charge on the
battery. Lieutenant-Colonel Crane was killed,
and Captain O'Brien mortally wounded. O'Brien
had at the first charge been severely wounded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the thigh. When we retreated to the woods, he
had showed me that his shoe was full of blood.
He had, however, returned to the fight after binding
up his wound with his handkerchief, and had
been killed at the edge of the woods. My Company
had, out of forty-five men engaged, lost two
killed and fourteen wounded. Of these all but
two of the wounded had been struck in the field
where we first drew the enemy's fire, and in a
space of time which I am confident did not exceed
three minutes.</p>

<p>As some 30,000 or 40,000 troops were in the
vicinity, who had not fired a shot, I supposed that
the battle would be renewed in the morning; but it
was not. The corps of General Sigel and McDowell
were moved to the front, but occupied
themselves only with gathering up the wounded.
On the 11th the enemy sent in a flag of truce,
asking for an armistice to bury the dead. This
was readily granted, for we also had still on the
battle-field many dead and severely wounded. On
the 12th it was found that the Confederates had
taken advantage of the truce to retreat during the
night. Indeed, they retired in such haste that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
left large numbers of their wounded in our hands.
General Sigel pursued them to the Rapidan,
while our Corps returned to Culpeper for a much-needed
rest.</p>

<p>A great deal of criticism has been heaped upon
all those who were prominently connected with
this battle. Banks has been assailed for fighting
the battle at all. It has seemed to many, an inexcusable
piece of folly that he should have ordered
the attack in such apparent ignorance of the position
and strength of the enemy, and so near sundown
that even if he had been successful, he could
not have reaped any advantage. I have, however,
doubted whether he ever made the order; but
when once it had been made, he was obliged to
put in his whole command or abandon everything
that had been gained. Captain Wilkins who
brought the order for our charge, later wandered
into the Confederate lines while carrying orders,
and I never heard of him again.</p>

<p>Pope has been criticized for not seeing that
Banks was properly supported; but all the evidence
obtainable shows that Pope did not wish or
expect to fight a battle at that time. McDowell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
has been criticized with particular bitterness for not
going to the aid of Banks, and charges of treachery
were freely made against him. It was quite generally
believed, even in his own command, that
McDowell had no heart in the cause; and this
belief&mdash;which later gained public expression in
the dying statement of Colonel Brodhead of the
First Michigan Cavalry, that he "died a victim to
the incompetency of Pope and the treachery of
McDowell"&mdash;caused his retirement as a corps
commander.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>The Army retreats Northward</i></h2>


<p>We remained at Culpeper until August 18,
when we were aroused at midnight and started
on the road to the Rappahannock. We crossed
over on the next day and went into camp about
half a mile from the river. During all that day
and night the army of General Pope was streaming
across the Rappahannock to the north side, only a
portion of his cavalry still remaining to the south.
There was a great deal of speculation among the
men as to the reason for this unexpected retrograde
movement. It was rumored that General McClellan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
had been compelled to withdraw his army
from the Peninsula, and that General Lee, released
from the defence of Richmond, was marching
our way. For once, rumor was correct. It
was not many days before the whole of Lee's army
was hunting to find an unguarded point at which
to cross the river.</p>

<p>About noon on the day after our crossing, I was
watching the movements of some of our cavalry
who still remained on the other side of the river.
I was standing on the top of one of the highest
knolls in the vicinity, from which I had a splendid
view of the country for a long distance southward.
For nearly two miles the land was clear of timber
or fences or any obstacle which could impede the
movements of cavalry. Observing that our cavalry
seemed to be coming back at rather a livelier
pace than usual, I noticed what appeared to be
either a large regiment or a small brigade of Confederate
cavalry emerge from the woods to the
south of the plain. They formed their lines and
moved to the attack.</p>

<p>Our men, also, were soon in motion. As they
approached each other the two bodies increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
their pace, until both seemed to be moving at full
speed. They met with a jar, and for some moments
it was impossible to distinguish friend from foe.
There could only be distinctly seen the flashing of
sabres in the sunlight as blows were struck and
parried, and the puffs of smoke from revolvers and
carbines. For ten minutes or more the stirring
fight went on without any apparent advantage to
either side. But now another regiment of our
cavalry, which had been out of sight up the river
at the beginning of the fight, came down upon the
Confederates at a hard gallop. It was but a
minute before the latter were retreating back to the
timber, perhaps hurried a little by a few shells
from one of our shore batteries. A little later, I
learned that our cavalry had taken about sixty
prisoners.</p>

<p>On the night of August 22 the enemy were expected
to make an attempt to cross the Rappahannock
at Beverly Ford, where I was stationed on
picket duty. During the night, however, the river
rose almost ten feet as the result of heavy rains in
the mountains. By morning, it was so raging a torrent
that crossing was impossible. As soon as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
light, the enemy opened fire on us with fourteen
pieces of artillery. I had already withdrawn my
men from the river bank and stationed them where
they could pour a heavy fire upon the Confederates,
should they attempt to lay a bridge. I was
therefore in a good position to watch at leisure the
artillery duel which ensued. For two hours the
shot flew back and forth across the stream, without,
however, great damage to our side. At the
end of that time the Confederates apparently had
had enough and withdrew from their position.</p>

<p>The succeeding days were passed in hard
marching, with hot weather, no tents or blankets,
short rations, and a poor country to forage in. The
enemy occasionally made demonstration as though
to cross at the fords of the Rappahannock, but all
the while moving up toward the mountains. On
the evening of August 27, while we were in camp
near Warrenton Junction, rumors began to circulate
that they had appeared in large force at
Manassas Junction, and were threatening to cut
off our retreat to Washington. The next morning
we were called out at three o'clock, and soon after
were on the road to the Junction. The corps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Generals Heintzelman and Fitz-John Porter,
which had been marching toward Warrenton, had
also been turned back and were directly in our advance.
We marched rapidly to Kettle River, a
small stream about five miles from the Junction,
where we were detailed to guard a train of ninety
cars loaded with ammunition and provisions for our
army. Here we learned that the enemy had on
the previous day captured and destroyed at the
Junction over a hundred and fifty cars loaded with
supplies, but had in the morning encountered
Hooker's advance division near Kettle Run, and
had been driven with considerable loss beyond the
Junction. We found on our arrival at Kettle
Run, tangible evidence of the morning's fight, for
a good many of the dead were still lying around.</p>

<p>Cannonading commenced early on the morning
after our arrival, in the direction of Manassas, and
continued all day. It was evident that a severe battle
was in progress. Reports of our successes were
continually coming in; we appeared to be driving
the enemy at all points. It was said that the Confederates
were surrounded on three sides, and
hopes were strong that they would be captured before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the main body of their army came up. The
next morning, the battle was still in progress although
it seemed to be farther away than it had
been before. The most encouraging reports continued
to reach us, and at night General Pope was
credited with having said that our troops had won
a complete victory.</p>

<p>While the battle was in progress, we had been
occupied in rebuilding the bridge across Kettle
Run, which the enemy had destroyed on the first
day of their raid. We had it completed, and our
train of cars moved across to Bristoe Station by the
morning of the second day of the battle. We
bivouacked that night north of Broad Run, happy
in the thought that our troops had indeed vanquished
the foe.</p>

<p>The next morning we were ordered to return to
Bristoe. As we approached the station, dense
clouds of smoke were rolling upwards from the
place where we had left our cars. This gave us
notice that the reports of victory had been false.
The fact was, that the left wing of Pope's army
had been driven back the night before, and it had
been necessary to burn the cars in order to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
their falling into the hands of the enemy. It had
been possible to save only the supplies with which
they were loaded. Our Corps, moreover, having
received no notice of the reverse, was now in grave
danger of being cut off from the remainder of the
army. We managed, however, by rapid marching
over a circuitous route to reach the north side of
Bull Run in safety.</p>

<p>The next day we marched to a short distance
beyond Centerville. Here we were halted, and
stood in the road on our arms during a driving rain,
while the battle of Chantilly was being fought
only a short distance to the north. We remained
standing in the road&mdash;or at least were supposed to
be standing&mdash;all that night, the rain pouring down
in torrents most of the time. After darkness had
set in, however, the men quietly began to disappear
into the neighboring woods, and soon I alone
of all my Company was actually standing in the
road. I was not greatly troubled over the breach
of orders, for I knew that at the first intimation of
danger every man would be in his place. I too
found for myself as dry a place as possible, and
wrapping my rubber coat about me, tried to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a snatch of much-needed sleep. But I soon awoke
so thoroughly wet and cold that further slumber
was out of the question. I thereupon sought a fire
that some soldiers had built, and endeavored to
extract a bit of comfort from its friendly heat.
Just as I was beginning to feel its warmth, a number
of staff officers came along and ordered the
blaze extinguished, for, said they, it was against
the orders of General Banks. I stepped back into
the darkness so as not to be recognized, concluding
that if General Banks wanted that fire put out, he
would get no help from me. The men standing
near, however, kicked the burning brands apart as
though to put it out, and the officers passed on.
But they were not fifty feet away before the fire
had been rekindled and was again dispensing
cheer. This scene was repeated at frequent intervals
until daylight, the fire continuing to burn in
spite of all orders.</p>

<p>That morning we took the road about nine, and
marched until midnight. On the morning after,
we found that we were within the fortifications of
Alexandria. Two days later we crossed the
Potomac at Georgetown, and went into camp at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Tennalleytown, D. C. Our wagons and camp
equipage had preceded us. A mail also was
awaiting us, the first that we had received since
leaving Culpeper Court House.</p>

<p>We now had leisure to reflect upon our situation.
It was indeed humiliating. Here we were,
after six months of campaigning, back again at the
point where we had started. The Grand Army
of the Potomac forced to seek the shelter of the
fortifications of Washington! The actual fighting
had usually been in our favor. Why was it,
then, that we had been forced back? We believed
that the answer lay entirely in the fact that
we had been outgeneralled. We felt that Pope
and McDowell were the Jonahs who should go
overboard. And overboard they went, not to be
heard of again during the war. The reappointment
of McClellan to command was everywhere
received with pleasure. So far as my acquaintance
went, the feeling was unanimous in his favor.</p>

<p>For several days we remained in camp enjoying
the luxury of tents and beds after our strenuous
experiences on the march. New regiments were
in the meantime assigned to the old brigades.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Ours received the Thirteenth New Jersey and the
One Hundred Seventh New York, with a new
corps commander in the person of General Mansfield.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>Moving Toward the Enemy</i></h2>


<p>On September 5 it was definitely rumored in
camp that the enemy had crossed into Maryland
by way of Edward's Ferry. All of the Army of
the Potomac were soon after moving up the river
toward Darnestown, where a defensive position
was taken and the enemy's movements awaited.
There were no further developments until the
10th, when an order came from General McClellan
to store in Washington all of the officers' baggage
and the company tents and property, and
turn over the teams to be used in hauling provisions
and ammunition. This looked more like business
than anything we had yet seen.</p>

<p>The next morning we began to move in earnest,
passing through Darnestown, and on toward Frederick
City. On the 12th we made a long march
to Ijamsville, where we heard from one party of
citizens that the enemy were evacuating Frederick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
City, and from another that they were preparing to
fight us at the crossing of the Monocacy River.
In the morning, we were early on the road, marching
rapidly to the ford of the Monocacy, and
crossing without trouble. As we approached
Frederick, we could hear the firing of the advance
of Burnside's Corps, as they were driving the rear
guard of the retreating enemy from the passes of
the Catoctin Mountains, about five miles west of
the city. Over 800 prisoners were sent back that
day, mostly stragglers and deserters, who had
soldiered as long as they wished.</p>

<p>That night we camped near Frederick City, a
large portion of our Regiment taking advantage of
the opportunity to visit old friends and acquaintances
in that place. We had been there so long
during the past year that it seemed to us almost
like home. The Confederates had been in possession
for nearly a week, and many stories were
told of the good people who had displayed their
loyalty under adverse circumstances. The real
heroine of the town was old Barbara Fritchie, who
had kept a Union flag waving from her window
during all the time of the Confederate occupation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Her name has been immortalized by Whittier. I
know that in recent years it has been said that no
such person ever lived, and that the flag was not
displayed. But I heard the story told within
twenty-four hours after the Confederate army had
left Frederick, from persons who knew the circumstances,
and I am going to believe it until there is
more positive proof than I have yet seen, that it is
not true.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>Battle of South Mountain</i></h2>


<p>We were ready to march by four o'clock on the
morning of the 14th. But we might as well have
stayed in camp until seven. The road west from
Frederick was a fine, broad turnpike, wide enough
for two or three wagons abreast, but it was now
completely choked with the ammunition and provision
wagons of the troops in advance. Even
after we did finally get started, and were clear of
the town, we had to march through the fields and
woods on either side of the road.</p>

<p>When we reached the top of the Catoctin Mountains,
we could hear the sound of artillery and
musketry fire on the next mountain ridge beyond.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Occasionally we could even catch a glimpse of the
lines of our troops as they moved up the slopes to
assault the position of the enemy. We were now
rapidly marched down the mountain and turned
off by a circuitous route to the right, in order to
strike the enemy on the left flank. Before we
could reach their position, however, it had already
been carried by assault, and the enemy had taken
advantage of the darkness to make good their retreat.
Such was the battle of South Mountain.</p>

<p>We now countermarched to the turnpike near
Middletown, where we went into camp at one
o'clock in the morning. We had been on the road
for twenty-two consecutive hours, most of the time
climbing over rocks and through brush on the
mountain side. Again we were on the march, at
eight o'clock the next morning, crossing South
Mountain as we had crossed the Catoctin Mountains,
with the wagon train occupying the road and
the troops in the woods along the side. We passed
through Boonsborough in the afternoon, and by
night had reached nearly to Keedysville.</p>

<p>The road was strewn with the muskets and
other accoutrements of the enemy fleeing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
South Mountain, together with a great deal of
plunder that they had gathered in Maryland.
There was every indication that they had retreated
in a state of demoralization. The houses in Boonsborough
and the vicinity were filled with their
wounded, and we were constantly meeting squads
of from twenty to one hundred prisoners who were
being sent back from the front. Occasional artillery
firing in the front seemed to indicate that we
were being waited for not far ahead.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>Battle of Antietam</i></h2>


<p>On the morning of the 16th we moved forward
to a position behind a range of low hills near Antietam
Creek, and there we remained until night,
undisturbed save by occasional shots from the
enemy's batteries, posted in the hills on the opposite
side of the creek. The remainder of our
army kept coming up all day, taking position as
they arrived, until at night it was understood that
they were all at hand with the exception of Franklin's
Corps, which had gone to the relief of Harpers
Ferry. At about nine o'clock we were
called up and moved across Antietam Creek, close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to the enemy's lines, where we lay down to secure
such rest as we might in preparation for the next
day's fight. General Hooker's Corps lay in position,
just in front of us.</p>

<p>It was reported that night that Harpers Ferry
had been surrendered by Colonel Miles without a
struggle, and when the relieving force of General
Franklin was within three miles. It was rumored
also that Miles had been shot by the men of his
own command when they learned that they had
been surrendered.</p>

<p>We were awakened soon after daylight by the
sound of heavy cannonading in the front. It had
been raining during the night, but now the sky
was clear and the sun shining. The men hurried
into the ranks, and the Corps formed in close column
by companies. We moved a short distance to
the right, then sat down to await developments.
As battery after battery came into action, the artillery
firing continually increased in rapidity, until
for a few minutes the roar would be continuous.
Then there would be a lull, and the sharp crack
of the musketry would be heard, as the skirmishers
pushed forward through the timber. Now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
scattering musketry fire increased into crashing volleys;
as more and more troops became engaged,
the volleys developed into one continuous roar, like
the roll of distant thunder.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes we became aware by
sight, as well as by sound, that a bloody battle was
in progress; a constant stream of wounded men was
coming back to the field hospital in the rear.
Many were but slightly wounded and still clung to
their muskets as they hurried back to have their
wounds dressed. They would stop on their way,
for a moment, hastily to tell how they were "driving
the Johnnies" in the front. Others, more seriously
hurt, were being helped along by comrades;
while others, still more unfortunate, lay silent on
stretchers as they were borne back by ambulance
men and musicians. Soon, a number of ammunition
wagons which had ventured too close to the
front, came dashing by us to seek shelter behind a
neighboring hill. They were followed shortly
after by a dismounted cannon being dragged back
for repairs. Now came a temporary lull in the
musketry. The thunder of the artillery increased
as if in compensation; but rising above all came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the cheers of our comrades in the front, announcing
that the opening engagement had ended in victory.</p>

<p>The pause in the musketry was of short duration.
The enemy, largely renforced, soon attacked
in their turn, making desperate efforts to regain
the ground that they had lost. Upon our
side, more troops to the right and left came into
action, and the battle was soon raging again with
redoubled fury. The enemy in our immediate
front seemed to have largely increased their artillery,
and scattering shot and shell were dropping
around us.</p>

<p>At length our First Brigade was sent into action.
We soon followed, at double-quick, in close column
by companies. Passing rapidly through the
woods, we emerged upon the field a little northeast
of the old Dunkard church, and our Regiment
deployed in line. The man&oelig;uvre was executed
as though we had been on a parade ground instead
of a battle-field. I have seldom seen it better done.</p>

<p>Immediately on our right and about one hundred
yards to the front, was posted one of our batteries
of twelve-pound brass guns. It had evidently
been in action for some time. All of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
horses were killed or crippled, and the gunners
were just falling back before the advancing Confederate
line of battle. To the left of the battery,
and stretching off to the woods directly in our
front, stood the remnants of a brigade, still stubbornly
contesting the advance of the enemy's infantry.
Our Regiment moved forward to the battery,
the artillerymen at the same time returning to
their guns. The Second Massachusetts took
position to the right; the Twenty-Seventh Indiana
came up on the left.</p>

<p>The Confederate infantry moved steadily
across the corn-field, while the decimated brigade
in its path fell back, step by step. We were
obliged to wait before commencing fire, until they
could be moved out of the way. Then we opened
fire from one end of the line to the other. The
enemy were handicapped by the fact that they
were moving diagonally across our front, instead
of directly toward us, and our fire was terribly
severe, so it was not long before they broke and
ran back to the woods. Immediately, however,
another line was coming up, this time confronting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
us squarely. And now commenced the work in
earnest.</p>

<p>Our position was in a stubble-field. The ground
in front of us sloped gently downward, so that we
were fifteen or twenty feet higher than the enemy.
About a hundred yards in our front was a rail
fence, beyond which lay another open field. The
previous day, that field had contained a luxuriant
growth of ripening corn; now it was cut by bullets
and trampled by men and horses, until scarce a
vestige of the crop remained.</p>

<p>For a time, the enemy came on rapidly, without
firing a shot. Their right, like our left, was "in
the air" and about even with us. They were as
gallant fellows as ever moved to an assault. One
could but admire the steady courage with which
they approached us; great gaps being made in
their lines at every discharge of our grape- and
canister-laden twelve-pounders, and our bullets
also wore them away at every step. A portion of
these stern fighters reached the fence; none came
farther. They there stopped and opened fire on
our lines. From our higher ground we could see
the steady stream of their wounded being helped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to the rear. Still they held on, returning fire for
fire; and we too were suffering terribly. At
length the Confederates had been reduced to a
mere handful; it was hopeless to hold on any
longer, and they fell back toward the woods. But
before they had reached there, another of their
brigades was coming up behind them. The newcomers,
however, halted and opened fire at nearly
double the distance that their predecessors
had taken. Soon they also began to waver, then
suddenly broke, and joined their comrades in the
flight to the woods.</p>

<p>As they all disappeared toward the timber,
General Hooker rode up and ordered us to fix
bayonets and pursue. With a whoop and hurrah
our Regiment and the Twenty-Seventh Indiana
started down through the corn-field, General
Hooker himself leading like a captain. It was
such traits as this that made him popular, even
with those who did not think him fit for high command.
We had passed fairly into the corn-field,
which was literally strewn with the dead bodies
of Confederates, when a staff officer rode up, and
ordered us to get out of the way, for General Sumner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
wished to put in a division at that point. This
was all that prevented us from assaulting a position
with about a hundred and fifty men, which a few
minutes later Sedgwick's Division, with five or
six thousand, failed to carry.</p>

<p>We moved back out of the corn-field to our
old position, and immediately after Sedgwick's
Division came in from the northeast. As they
moved forward in perfect line to the attack, they
presented a splendid sight, even to old soldiers,
and we had little doubt that they would sweep
everything before them. They marched in three
parallel lines, one behind the other, and about
seventy-five yards apart. The brigade and field
officers, aware of the peculiar danger of being on
horseback in such a place, all marched with their
men on foot. The only mounted officer in the entire
division was old General Sumner himself,
who rode a little in the rear of his first line. He
was then nearly seventy years of age, perfectly
grey but still proudly erect. As he stretched his
tall form to its full height on his horse, in order to
see what might be in front of his men, he was the
most conspicuous object on the field, and undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
was the target for every Confederate sharpshooter
in sight.</p>

<p>No resistance of consequence was met until the
advance brigade was out of sight in the woods, and
the Second Brigade was just at the edge. Then
a heavy musketry fire showed that the enemy had
reformed their lines and were making a stubborn
fight. Their artillery also now opened fire, and
shells and round shot began to fall in our neighborhood.
It soon became evident to us, who were
spectators of the fight, that General Sumner's formation
had been a serious mistake. His second
and third brigades were exposed to a heavy fire
from the enemy, yet they could not reply on account
of the line in front of them. They soon
broke up in confusion, therefore, and fell back out
of range. The leading brigade held on for over
half an hour, to the position that it had gained in
the woods, when it also fell back, with but a
small portion of the magnificent line which a short
time before had so gallantly gone forward to the
attack.</p>

<p>The remnant of our Regiment, together with
portions of several other like commands, were now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
stationed at the edge of the woods behind a battery
of artillery. There was little more active
fighting, however, in that part of the field during
the remainder of the day. At one time the enemy
made an attempt to recover the lost ground in the
corn-field, but the batteries easily drove them back
to the woods. Soon after twelve o'clock we were
relieved by fresh troops and moved a short distance
to the rear. With the friendly aid of a rail fence
we now built a fire, and prepared our dinner of
hardtack and coffee, and remained quiet for the
rest of the day. To the left the firing continued
until late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Many of our gallant boys laid down their lives
that bloody day on the battle-field of Antietam.
In the morning, our Regiment had taken into the
fight twelve officers and not quite 300 enlisted
men. The number was thus small because our
wounded from Cedar Mountain had not yet rejoined
us, and hard marching had sent others to
the hospital. Of the twelve officers, we lost one
killed and seven severely wounded. The Colonel
had been hit in the head by a bullet, which had
cut just deep enough to draw blood; while I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
received a severe bruise from a spent ball. Of
our 300 privates, we lost 194 in killed and
wounded. The Twenty-Seventh Indiana on our
left, had lost about half of its men; the Second
Massachusetts on the right, had suffered in about
the same proportion.</p>

<p>In my Company, of the thirty men whom I took
into the field, two had been killed, two mortally
wounded, and sixteen so severely hurt, that they
were ordered to the hospital. Of all that Company,
only one had escaped without the mark of
a bullet upon his person or his clothes. Every one
of our color-guard, composed of a corporal from
each company, had been shot down before the
battle was over. As its bearers fell, the flag had
been passed along the line until it had come into
the hands of one of my privates, Joseph Collins,
who carried it the remainder of the day. The
color-bearers of the enemy had been even more unfortunate.
On our charge into the corn-field, our
men picked up several of their banners that had
fallen with their bearers.</p>

<p>When night at length put a merciful end to the
battle, all along the line, both thoroughly-worn-out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
armies were, I am sure, glad for the chance to
rest. I know that I, for one, was completely exhausted.
The sun had scarcely set before I had
wrapped myself in my overcoat, and with my haversack
for a pillow, was sound asleep, quite oblivious
of the fact that the field of the dead was
only a few steps away. In the morning we were
early astir expecting a renewal of the fight. Our
men threw away all of their old muskets, and
armed themselves with the new Springfield rifles of
the improved pattern, picked up on the battle-field.
Ammunition and rations were issued, and every
preparation made to receive the enemy. All was
quiet, however, and so remained for the rest of the
day. At about noon, General Franklin's Corps
came up from Harpers Ferry and took position on
our right.</p>

<p>During that afternoon I went over the corn-field
that had been the scene of the hardest fighting
the previous day. It was a sight which once seen
could never be forgotten. The dead lay as they
had fallen, and in such dreadful numbers! Several
times had the ground been fought over; the
bodies of brave men were so thickly strewn over it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
that one might for rods have walked on corpses
without touching the ground.</p>

<p>When we advanced our lines, the morning of
the 19th, the enemy had disappeared. Only his
picket line still remained, and that surrendered
without resistance. These prisoners appeared to
be dazed with discouragement; many of them
seemed glad to have been taken. Like the thousands
whom we had captured during the heat of
the battle, they were destitute of clothing, and their
haversacks contained nothing but raw corn.</p>

<h2><i>In Winter Quarters</i></h2>


<p>So far as we were concerned, the battle of Antietam
ended active campaigning for the winter of
1862. During the next two months we moved
about between Harpers Ferry and the mouth of
Antietam Creek, doing occasional guard duty, and
for the most part passing the time uneventfully.
On October 1 President Lincoln visited our camp
at Maryland Heights. It seemed to me that he
did full justice to his reputation for homeliness.
He came entirely unannounced, but we hurriedly
turned out the Regiment and presented arms. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a time, on account of their greenness, the new regiments
in camp furnished a source of amusement.
Most of them had received large bounties on enlistment,
and the old soldiers taunted them as
bounty-bought; they were told that the Government
could have secured mules much cheaper.</p>

<p>On November 13 came my commission as First
Lieutenant of Company E. This did not materially
change my position, for I had been in command
of a company ever since the battle of Antietam.
On November 17 we went into winter
camp at Fairfax Station, but sometime in January
removed to Stafford Court House. In the meantime
McClellan had been finally removed from
the command of the Army of the Potomac; and
Burnside, who had followed him, had in his turn,
been relieved after the battle of Fredericksburg,
by General Joe Hooker.</p>

<p>Hooker was evidently determined to build up
a thoroughly efficient army, and spent the winter
in constant efforts toward improving the condition
and effectiveness of his troops. Inspections became
extremely rigid; they extended not only to
arms and equipment, but to camp and garrison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
equipage, policing, and sanitation. Regiments
reaching the highest standard for general efficiency
and appearance were awarded leaves of absence
for two officers at a time for fifteen days each, and
furloughs for two men at a time, in each company,
for the same period. Regiments that at first were
not up to standard, were in the course of the winter
given their furloughs as they attained efficiency.</p>

<p>Our Regiment was one of the eleven in the entire
army which, when the first inspection was
made, proved to be in the highest degree of efficiency.
Leaves of absence and furloughs commenced
at once, and before spring all who cared
to go had a chance to visit their homes. The distance
to Wisconsin was too great to make it profitable
for me to return; so I visited a sister in New
York State, taking advantage of this opportunity
to see the sights of New York City and Washington.</p>

<p>During the winter the army was gradually
strengthened by the return of convalescents.
Thus our Regiment was able by spring once more
to muster about 400 muskets. Many of the permanently
disabled officers were transferred to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
invalid corps, and those who were sick were discharged,
thus giving way to more vigorous and
able-bodied men. The army was now in the best
condition that it had ever been in, and we all
looked forward to a successful campaign.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>Chancellorsville</i></h2>


<p>On the morning of April 27, 1863, we left our
winter camp at Stafford Court House and marched
to Kelly's Ford on the Rappahannock. Pontoon
bridges had been laid ahead of us, and the
Eleventh Corps had already crossed. Early on
the morning of the 29th, we followed, and started
at once for Germanna Ford on the Rapidan, twelve
miles off. Three corps of the Army of the Potomac
were engaged in the expedition&mdash;the Fifth,
Eleventh and Twelfth. Our Corps, the Twelfth,
after crossing, pushed on to the head of the column,
and our Brigade was given the position of honor
in the advance. We carried eight days' rations
and a hundred rounds of ammunition. In addition,
several pack mules laden with boxes of cartridges
followed each regiment, so that we felt sure
we were out for business. The men were in good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
spirits, however, and notwithstanding the heavy
loads marched rapidly.</p>

<p>We arrived at the ford in about four hours, without
alarming the enemy. A portion of the Regiment
were deployed as skirmishers under cover
of the woods, three or four hundred yards from the
river bank. At the word of command they moved
on the run down to the river. Here each man
hastily found for himself such shelter as he could,
behind trees and brush, and opened fire on the
enemy who were occupying some buildings on the
opposite side. As we approached the river about
a dozen Confederates started to run up the hill
back of their position, in an attempt to escape.
Our men were excellent marksmen, however, and
after two had been killed and several others
wounded, the rest of the enemy hastened back to
the shelter of the buildings. Occasionally some
fellow would fire at us from a window, but the
puff of smoke from his gun would make him immediately
the target for every musket within range,
and that practice was soon discouraged. In less
than ten minutes from the time when the skirmish
commenced, the Southerners had hung out a white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
rag and surrendered. The swift-flowing Rapidan,
nearly three hundred feet wide, separated
them from us, but we compelled them to wade
over. In this way, without a casualty to ourselves,
we bagged 101 prisoners, and not a man
escaped to the enemy to give warning of our approach.</p>

<p>We had just secured our prisoners when General
Slocum came up. He immediately took in
the situation, and ordered us to cross the river and
secure the heights on the other side. We had had
a good time laughing at our prisoners as we made
them cross over to us, with the water up to their
armpits; but when we had to go in ourselves, it did
not seem so funny. It was still early in the spring,
and the water was icy cold from the melting snow
in the mountains. Moreover, the current was so
swift that some mounted officers and cavalry who
went in ahead of us could scarcely keep a footing.
If a horse stumbled, he was washed off his feet in
an instant and carried down stream. In fact, one
man was drowned in such an accident, and several
others had narrow escapes. We prepared for
crossing by placing our ammunition and provisions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and such valuables as would be injured by the
water, on the ends of the muskets or on our heads,
and plunged in. We had the small men distributed
among the large ones, and in this way
crossed without serious trouble. We were followed
in the same manner by the Second Massachusetts.
Once across we pushed rapidly for the
hill overlooking the ford, where we took a strong
position and threw out our pickets.</p>

<p>The pontoon train had by this time come up,
and a bridge was soon built. The remainder of
our Corps and the Eleventh Corps then crossed
and went into camp ahead of us. We now gathered
about our fires, and dried out our clothes in
order to have them once more in comfortable shape
by bed-time.</p>

<p>The next morning we moved to Chancellorsville,
where we arrived early in the day. It is a
very big name for a very small place; at that time
it contained only one house. The position which
we had thus gained uncovered the road to United
States Ford, on the Rappahannock. Here another
pontoon bridge was laid, and General
Hooker crossed it with his force. We were all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the best of spirits, for in securing this advantage of
position we thought that the victory had already
been gained.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 1 our Brigade engaged
in a successful reconnoissance toward Fredericksburg,
in which we captured a number of prisoners.
On our return to Chancellorsville we were sent to
occupy a slight rise of ground at Hazel Grove,
about a mile southwest of Chancellor House.
Here, in a sharp skirmish with the enemy, Lieutenant-Colonel
Scott was shot through the head by a
chance ball and instantly killed. During the afternoon,
General Hooker rode around the lines,
jubilant over the success of his movements. Several
times he remarked that now he had got the
Confederates where he wanted them, and they
would have to fight us on our own ground or be
destroyed. At that time the army still had unbounded
confidence in him; but it seemed to me a
bit curious that the man who was ready at Antietam
to lead 150 men to a charge on the whole
Southern army, should now get into entrenchment
when he had at his command 150,000 soldiers.</p>

<p>The night passed off without incident. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
about ten o'clock the next morning it was discovered
that the enemy were moving wagon trains
toward the southwest. Birney's Division of the
Fifth Corps, which had been in position somewhere
in our rear, was sent out at about noon to
stop them. A sharp musketry fire for a minute or
two indicated to us that the attack had been made,
and soon after several hundred Southern prisoners
were sent back to us under guard. At about
four in the afternoon, our Regiment was ordered to
deploy as skirmishers through the woods upon the
left of Birney, to capture Confederate stragglers
who were believed to be lurking there in large
numbers. Obedient to these orders we piled up
our knapsacks, overcoats, and other baggage, behind
the breastworks we had built, and moved
forward into the woods. We had advanced
about half a mile from our entrenchments, when
the storm broke loose in the rear. The army of
Stonewall Jackson had struck the Eleventh Corps
in the flank and rear, and had brushed it away
like a swarm of flies before a hurricane. I was
afterward told that the defeated Corps came
tumbling along through the woods, an indiscriminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
mass of flying men, pack mules with their
packs turned, and stray artillery horses. Nor did
they bring up until they were stopped at Chancellorsville
by three regiments of Hooker's cavalry.
However, the best troops in the world could not,
if struck in the same way, have stood against such
an attack.</p>

<p>Our line was now halted to await developments.
Very soon a Confederate battery was in position
on the hill which we had just left, and was throwing
shells over toward Chancellor House. Directly
in our front, to the south, another battery was
firing in the same direction. We were hidden from
this second battery by timber and underbrush, but
were so close to it that in the intervals of the firing
we could distinctly hear the strokes of swabs and
rammers as the guns were swabbed out, and the
charges rammed home. From my position I could
see the battery near our old entrenchments, as it
came up and commenced firing. However, it did
not remain there long. The fire from our own
batteries, near the Chancellor House, blew up two
caissons or their limber chests, and the rest of the
Southern battery sought a safer place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>The roar of artillery and musketry still continued
around the Chancellor House and to the west
of it; but we could tell by the sound of the firing
that the Confederate advance had been stayed.
By seven o'clock darkness had settled over the
field, bringing with it for a time comparative quiet.
We began to look around now, for a way out of
the woods, and back to our Corps. Our scouts
soon found that Geary's Division still held the entrenchments
which they had built the night before,
and that we might return safely through their
lines to the Chancellor House. By nine o'clock,
therefore, we were once more in line of battle
with the rest of the Brigade, in the woods west
of the House.</p>

<p>Shortly after our return, occurred the confusion
in which Stonewall Jackson was mortally
wounded. Our picket line had been driven in by
the enemy, and we had fired a volley or two into
the woods on our front. At the same time we had
been fired on in the darkness by the Thirteenth
New Jersey. General Jackson was struck just at
this time, in the woods into which we had fired.
It has been presumed that he was hit by his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
men, but there is a possibility that the bullet came
from the Third Wisconsin.</p>

<p>We secured but little sleep that night. Our artillery
continued throwing shot and shell over our
heads into the woods fronting us, where the enemy
were supposed to be in force. At midnight the
Confederates again attacked us; but Birney's Division,
which had been cut off from us in the afternoon
by Jackson's attack, struck them with fixed
bayonets in the flank at the same time that we
opened on them in the front&mdash;and of course we
made short work of them. We had now regained
the ground where we had left our knapsacks, but
for fear of another attack, the officers would not
let us go up after them. So we shivered miserably
through the night, and in the morning arose thoroughly
chilled.</p>

<p>The enemy, however, soon gave us enough to do
to warm our blood. Birney's Division had, during
the night, taken a new position in our advance, at
Hazel Grove. It was attacked early Sunday
morning, and in the course of an hour driven back
with the reported loss of one of its batteries. As
Birney's men passed back over us, the enemy came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
on, flushed with victory, and in some disorder.
But in a few minutes we sent them back, in worse
disorder than they had come. We followed
them for a quarter of a mile, but there encountered
a second line. In a short time we had the satisfaction
of seeing their backs, also, dimly in the distance.
Colonel Colgrove of the Twenty-Seventh
Indiana, who was commanding the Brigade, now
ordered a bayonet charge; but before we were
fairly started, General Ruger sent orders not to
advance any farther. Soon the enemy attacked
again; but after a stubborn fight we sent them
back for a third time, their ranks disorganized and
the ground thickly strewn with their dead.</p>

<p>It was now near nine o'clock. We had been
fighting continuously for three hours, and all of the
ammunition that we carried had been exhausted.
That carried by the pack mules had been distributed,
also, and was nearly all fired away. The
muskets had become so heated and foul that it was
difficult to load them. Some of the pieces were
so hot that the cartridge would explode as soon as
it struck the bottom of the gun, and before the man
had been able to aim. Because of this, we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
relieved by a fresh brigade, and marched back
about a mile to the rear. From there we were sent
to a position a little northeast of the Chancellor
House, where we built breastworks and remained
until the army was withdrawn across the river.</p>

<p>All the rest of the day we could hear the firing
to our right, and the next day, off in the direction
of Fredericksburg, where Sedgwick's Corps was
engaged; but we made no move. We only sat
around, wearily watching the time pass away,
until the night of the 5th, when preparations began
to be made for the withdrawal of the army to the
north bank of the river. The night was cold and
rainy. Our blankets and overcoats had been lost,
for we had left them on the second night of the
battle to pick up stragglers, and fires were not permitted,
lest they reveal our movement. As we
shivered through the long, dark hours, all the admiration
vanished that we had previously felt for
Fighting Joe Hooker.</p>

<p>Toward day we silently withdrew from the entrenchments
we had made, and marched off to the
river. We found when we came near, however,
that the approaches to the bridge were still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
crowded with the moving troops; we had, therefore,
to double-quick back to the entrenchments,
and wait until the bridge was cleared. Then we
crossed over, the last of the army, entirely unmolested
except for a few shells thrown by a Confederate
battery.</p>

<p>We now returned to Stafford Court House, and
at night pitched our tents on the very ground we
had left ten days before. We were all thoroughly
discouraged over the outcome of our expedition,
and feeling, as one of our officers expressed it,
"that we had gone out for wool, and come back
shorn." The old soldiers who took part in that
movement cannot think of it, to this day, but with
the strongest feelings of disgust.</p>

<p>The camp that we occupied on our return to
Stafford Court House was one of the best we ever
had. It was an old orchard, with a vacant field
near by for a drill and parade ground. Our
friends, the Second Massachusetts, occupied one
end of the orchard and we the other. Between us
was a good baseball ground, where we amused
ourselves at playing ball or pitching quoits. Every
night after supper, the officers of the two regiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
would get together for a big game, while the
rank and file would follow suit, and our drill
ground would present an animated sight. Thus
we whiled away the time with considerable comfort,
often speculating on the possibility of the enemy
coming across the river to attack us. So many
regiments of two-year men and nine-months men
were being mustered out of the service, that we
did not consider it at all likely that we would cross
the river until our ranks were filled by the conscription
which had then been ordered.</p>

<h2><i>A Cavalry Expedition</i></h2>


<p>On June 6 this easy life came to an end. The
company commanders of our Regiment were summoned
to the Colonel's tent, and informed that the
Regiment had been selected to accompany a cavalry
expedition. We were instructed to leave behind
all baggage not carried on the persons of the
men, and to take only those who could march thirty
miles a day. The expedition was to be composed
of the two best regiments in each corps&mdash;the Second
Massachusetts and ourselves having been selected
from the Twelfth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>We left our camp at about six o'clock and
marched that night to Spott Tavern, fifteen miles
away. The next day we reached Bealeton Station,
where we bivouacked in the woods until the
night of the 8th, awaiting the arrival of our cavalry.
We were joined here by a number of other
regiments, the whole force being under command
of General Ames. Our State pride was highly
gratified to find four Wisconsin regiments in this
detail of picked commands from every corps.</p>

<p>On the night of the 8th, our whole force, infantry,
artillery, and cavalry, moved down to the
Rappahannock at Beverly Ford. The next
morning, a portion of the Third Wisconsin was
deployed to cover the crossing; but the enemy had
not discovered us, and we passed over without
trouble. The cavalry now pushed on to Brandy
Station, on the railroad; the infantry following,
with our detachment in the lead. The cavalry
were soon briskly engaged, and in a little while
Colonel Davis, their commanding officer, was
brought back mortally wounded. The infantry
was now disposed on the flanks, to guard the cavalry
from being taken at a disadvantage. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
fighting soon became general, being mostly by detached
companies deployed as skirmishers. At
one time, in advancing with my Company to clear
out a piece of woods, I had a lively fight for a
short time; five men out of the twenty with me
were severely wounded before we drove the enemy
from their shelter. At another time, Company
D succeeded in getting on the flank and rear
of a North Carolina regiment, and captured over
a hundred prisoners. Some of our cavalry regiments
were pretty severely handled at the beginning
of the fight, especially before the infantry
came up. On the whole, however, the expedition
was a success, resulting in the capture of the headquarters
of the Confederate cavalry leader, General
J. E. B. Stuart, together with many valuable
papers and orders relating to the contemplated invasion
of the North.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>Gettysburg</i></h2>


<p>We now recrossed Beverly Ford and went into
camp until the 12th. Then we learned that the
Confederate army was on the move toward the
North, and that our army was marching to Manassas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Junction and Centerville. We therefore
marched in the same direction, and on the 16th
rejoined our Corps near Centerville. Reaching
Leesburg on the 18th, we went into camp. We
had no definite information as to the location of
the Confederate army, but rather suspected that it
was moving into the Shenandoah Valley. This
suspicion was confirmed when we learned that
they had occupied Winchester and Martinsburg.
We heard of them next as crossing the Potomac at
Williamsport and marching into Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>During our stay at Leesburg, several men from
a New York regiment were shot for desertion.
They were the first executions for that crime in our
army, and for a time, they produced a great sensation.
On the 26th we crossed the Potomac at
Edward's Ferry, and proceeded up the river to the
mouth of the Monocacy; thence we moved across
to Frederick City, where we went into camp early
on the afternoon of the 28th.</p>

<p>During the night I learned that our Division
was under marching orders to strike for Williamsport
in the morning, and destroy the bridge on
which the enemy had crossed the Potomac. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
were to destroy, also, all boats and ferries that
might be used by the Confederates in a retreat.
Then we were to rejoin the army if we could; if
not, to move west to Cumberland, and rejoin as
opportunity offered. With morning, however,
came a change of commanders, and with it also,
a change of orders. General Hooker had been
superseded by General Meade, and now we were
ordered northward to follow the army that had
gone ahead.</p>

<p>At noon on July 1, while we were preparing
our dinner at Two Taverns, some eight miles
south of Gettysburg, the distant rumbling of artillery
to the north announced to us the opening
of a great battle. The cannonading became more
and more furious as the minutes passed, until in
the distance it sounded like one continual roll of
thunder. At length came the order to march, and
in five minutes we were on the road to the front
as fast as our strength could take us. As we
trudged along, we met hundreds of Confederate
prisoners being sent to the rear, as well as a good
many of our own wounded, on their way to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
field hospitals. Of stragglers, there were exceptionally
few.</p>

<p>On the run we reached Cemetery Ridge, where
we learned that the First and Eleventh corps had
been compelled to fall back through the town of
Gettysburg. They had taken a new position on a
ridge east of the city. A portion of our Brigade
now filed off to the right, across Rock Creek,
thence north about half a mile; and then, having
deployed about half of our Regiment as skirmishers,
advanced toward the west until we were
sharply engaged with the enemy's skirmishers.
Only a little over two hours had passed from the
time when we received the order to march eight
miles distant, before we were in position on the
extreme right of the line of battle, checking the advance
of the enemy in that direction. There we
remained until sunset, when we were relieved by
the cavalry, and recrossed Rock Creek to the
west side.</p>

<p>As the remainder of our Corps had come up,
they took position on the right of the First Corps.
We now rejoined them there, our own right resting
on Rock Creek. Immediately we began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
throw up breastworks, and by evening had built
for ourselves quite respectable entrenchments. It
rained during most of the night; but in spite of
that and the enemy, we secured a good rest for the
next day's work.</p>

<p>Early the next morning we were stirring, in anticipation
of an attack; but until noon there was
nothing but skirmishing in our vicinity. Then
the storm broke loose on the extreme left of the
line, near Little Round Top, where Sickles's
Corps was situated. The place was entirely hidden
from our sight, and from the sounds we could
form no opinion as to how things were going;
but we were constantly receiving reports that
Sickles was either holding his own or driving the
enemy before him. In the light of subsequent
events, these reports seem to have been purposely
colored, in order to keep up our spirits. Occasional
demonstrations along our front kept us in constant
expectation of being attacked, but nothing of the
sort occurred.</p>

<p>About six o'clock we were hurried out of our
entrenchments at a double-quick toward Little
Round Top, where it was understood that Sickles's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Third Corps had been driven back with severe
loss. But before we arrived, the enemy had been
repulsed, and the firing ceased. We were now
started back to our entrenchments. We found, however,
upon our arrival, that the enemy had in our
absence taken possession of them. It was exasperating
to see them benefitting by our labors, but we
were somewhat consoled by the capture of a picket
of twenty Confederates, who in the darkness had
wandered into our line as we approached. We
were now obliged to form a new line, connecting
with our forces on the left as before, but swinging
back at an angle on the right to Rock Creek. We
thus presented to the enemy a semi-circular front,
which they could not penetrate without being
subjected to a cross fire from both sides.</p>

<p>During the night we remained unmolested. At
daylight the firing commenced. The ground occupied
by the enemy's skirmishers was a rocky bit
of woodland which furnished abundant cover for
sharpshooters. For a while they annoyed us, but
by nine o'clock we had dislodged them, and
driven them back to the cover of their breastworks.
On our left the enemy were making desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
efforts to dislodge from their entrenchments
Greene's Brigade and the troops of the First
Corps. Six times they came up to the assault, and
six times were repulsed, leaving the ground over
which they advanced literally covered with their
dead. At about eleven o'clock a portion of our
Division followed up these successes by charging
the Confederates in our front and sweeping them
entirely out of our entrenchments. They retired
only a short distance, however, showing that they
had not abandoned the contest.</p>

<p>For nearly two hours, complete quiet now succeeded
the roar and din of the battle. Not a
cannon was fired. Only an occasional musket shot
disturbed the silence that prevailed from one end
of the field to the other. We all felt, however,
that this was but a lull before the final burst
of the storm. The losses in our Regiment had thus
far been light, and our spirits ran high. We felt
entire confidence that no force that the Southerners
could bring against us could by direct assault
break our line at any point.</p>

<p>About one o'clock, the first shot was fired in the
tremendous artillery duel that preceded the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
desperate attempt to penetrate our center at Cemetery
Ridge. In five minutes three hundred guns
were pouring into one another, their deadly showers
of shot and shell, and making fearful havoc of
every thing that was not sheltered. From our position
in the woods we could see nothing of what
was going on in other parts of the line; but the air
above was filled with screaming shells, as they
flew back and forth on their deadly errand. In
some instances, shells from the Confederate batteries
in front of the Second Corps would pass entirely
over our lines, and land near the enemy in
our front; a great many of them fell in the open
space in our rear.</p>

<p>At one time during the progress of the cannonade,
a battery was placed in position on a hill
across Rock Creek directly in front of our Regiment,
and began to drop shells unpleasantly close
to us. But our friends of Battery M, of the First
New York Artillery, who had been with us since
the Brigade was organized, seemed to get their
range at once, and promptly silenced them. On a
trip over the field, the next day, I found the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
where they had been stationed marked by a
dozen dead horses and two exploded caissons.</p>

<p>During the cannonading, I took occasion to go
back into the woods a short distance in order to
get a view of what was going on. Everything in
sight gave evidence of the severity of the fire. All
those who were not actively engaged had sought
the shelter of rocks and trees or the inequalities of
the ground. Here and there mounted officers and
orderlies were riding across the field, although at
first sight it seemed as though a bird could scarcely
fly over it unharmed.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour the terrific artillery fire
slackened. Then for a few minutes it nearly
ceased. In the interval of silence, Pickett's Division
of Confederates was marching to the
charge. From my position I could not see them
coming on, but I knew that they were charging by
the old familiar Southern yell. Soon that was
drowned in the roar of musketry and artillery.
For a time all was turmoil and confusion. At
length the hearty cheers of our comrades rang out,
and we knew that the Confederate tide of invasion
had been safely rolled back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>While this assault was being made on the center,
constant demonstrations were being made on
our front, and we momentarily expected an attack.
None came, however, although during all the rest
of the day the enemy presented an unshaken line.
At night they silently withdrew, and on the morning
of the 4th our reconnoitering parties could find
nothing of them east of Seminary Ridge, save
their dead and severely wounded, whom they had
left on the field.</p>

<p>I spent some time that day going over the
ground occupied by the enemy in front of the
Twelfth Corps, and that over which Pickett had
made his now famous charge. From what I saw, I
felt certain that the enemy's losses were double our
own. Where they had assaulted Geary's Division
on the evening of the 2nd and on the morning
of the 3rd, the ground was so strewn with
their dead that it would have been possible to
walk for rods on dead bodies.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 5th the enemy was on
the road back to Virginia. We started the same
day following hard after them, on parallel roads
to the east. When they reached Williamsport,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
however, they turned on us with a bold front. It
had been raining almost constantly for several
weeks and the Potomac was a raging torrent,
which could not be forded. We were in hopes that
it might thus continue until our forces could be
concentrated to overwhelm them. On the morning
of the 13th, however, when we were ready to
move forward to the attack, they were gone. The
river had fallen during the night, and they had
made good their retreat.</p>

<p>For a time our Regiment led in the pursuit to the
ford at Falling Waters. Then we were filed out
to the side of the road to make way for General
Kilpatrick's Cavalry Brigade. They had scarcely
passed out of sight through a patch of woods,
when the roar of artillery and the sharp crack of
musketry announced that the enemy had been
found. We moved forward as rapidly as possible,
but were not in time to take any part in the
conflict. It appeared that when the cavalry had
emerged from the woods they had found a brigade
of Confederate infantry posted as a rear guard, on
a ridge overlooking the ford at Falling Waters.
They had immediately charged the enemy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
breastworks and had captured over a thousand
prisoners. They had won, besides, as trophies of
their skirmish, two pieces of artillery and four or
five colors inscribed with all the battles of the
Army of Northern Virginia. No further pursuit
was made. All of Lee's army, save only this rear
guard, had escaped safely to the south side of the
Potomac.</p>

<p>At about this time I sent to my home in Wisconsin
the following letter concerning Lee's invasion:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have wished a good many times that the rebs could
have had a month more among the people of Pennsylvania.
What little sympathy I had for them is gone now.
I cannot appreciate that disposition which will swindle a
friend to compensate for what an enemy has stolen from
you. In some cases the farmers would sell our men provisions
at reasonable rates and even give them something,
but the majority would ask from $.60 to $1.00 a loaf for
bread, and $.25 a quart for milk, and all such things in
proportion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our Corps now moved down the river to Harpers
Ferry, and crossing into Virginia, marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
leisurely along the eastern side of the Blue Ridge.
We found the abandoned fields through which
we passed overgrown with blackberry bushes, and
literally black with the ripened fruit. Every night
the men would go out from camp, and within easy
range find as many berries as they could eat. And
they were the best medicine we ever used. I
knew of cases of diarrhea that had become almost
chronic, soon cured by this diet.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>On Draft Riot duty</i></h2>


<p>On July 31 we went into camp near Kelly's
Ferry on the Rappahannock, where for the next
two weeks we did guard duty along the river and
rested from the fatigue of the long marches we
had made since leaving Stafford Court House.
On August 15 came orders to move. The next
morning we marched down to Rappahannock
Station in company with two other old regiments
of the Brigade, and boarded the cars for Alexandria,
on our way to New York. We were
joined at the station by five other regiments from
the different brigades, all under command of General
Ruger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>It seems that during the Confederate invasion
of Pennsylvania, the New York militia regiments
had been called off for duty in Washington, Baltimore,
and other places. A riotous mob in New
York City had taken advantage of this circumstance
to break out in defiance of the authorities,
and in resistance to the execution of the draft.
They had for several days held the city in a reign
of terror, and it had been necessary to stop all proceedings
under the draft.</p>

<p>After a wait of several days, we embarked
at Alexandria on the steamer "Merrimac," and
proceeded down the Potomac to the ocean, thence
to New York City. We landed at the foot of
Canal Street, and quietly marched to the City
Hall Park, where we arrived at about ten o'clock
on Saturday night. Barracks had been provided
for the enlisted men, but the officers' tents had not
arrived. This did not trouble us much, however,
as we had been without tents much of the time
during the past two months. Wrapped in our rubber
blankets, we lay on the grass and slept, as the
landlady in <i>Rob Roy</i> says, "like a good sword in
its scabbard." We awoke in the morning to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the sun well up in the heavens, and the park surrounded
by a crowd of curious people, surprised to
see a number of fairly well-dressed officers, sleeping
on the ground like a lot of vagrants.</p>

<p>The next day, tents were pitched and cots prepared,
and we were enjoying the delights of camp
life amid all the surroundings of civilization. We
had our dress parades and guard mountings with
all the pomp and show that 300 men can make, to
the delight of the great crowds who had come to
see the veterans of Antietam and Gettysburg.
Soon after our arrival I was detailed for duty in
the provost marshal's office of the Fifth District of
New York, where the rioting had been most desperate.
I had charge of the guard stationed there
to preserve order and see that those who brought
substitutes or recruits were promptly admitted.</p>

<p>There were no disturbances in the city while
we were there, except such as our men made for
themselves, at the instigation of the police. We
had plenty of bold fellows in the Regiment, who
wanted no better amusement than to raid a saloon
that had been the headquarters of the rioters.
They would get out of camp at night, and gather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in such a saloon pointed out to them by the police.
Then they would get up a row on some pretext,
and pitch bartenders and bummers out of doors,
and smash everything breakable about the place.
Everyone in the Regiment could find a way to enjoy
himself, and a policeman to help him, and
would have been content to stay in the city much
longer than we did.</p>

<p>On September 6 came orders to return to our
camp. We marched down to the Battery in the
evening, and were conveyed in small boats to the
steamer "Mississippi." In the morning, when I
awoke, we were rolling and pitching in a manner
that I had never before experienced in my limited
travels by water. A few of the officers had become
seasick on our way up to New York, and
those of us who escaped had enjoyed the fun of
laughing at them. I did not propose therefore to
give up now. So I dressed and started for breakfast.
One smell of the coffee, and I had business
on deck. But after gazing steadily over the side
of the vessel for a time, I felt better, and by noon
had recovered my appetite.</p>

<p>We arrived at Alexandria on the 9th. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the 13th we reached our camp at Kelly's Ferry,
and found the Thirteenth New Jersey drawn up
in line to welcome us back to the old Brigade.
We did not, however, remain long in camp.
Rumors began to float about, that Lee was sending
a part of his army to renforce Bragg in northwestern
Georgia. Within two days we were
again on the march to the Rapidan, behind which
the enemy had retired. We reached Raccoon
Ford on the 16th, and our Regiment and the
Second Massachusetts were detailed to support
pickets at the Ford.</p>

<p>We camped in the woods near the river, with
sentinels at night down to the bank, but during the
day they were withdrawn to the most convenient
cover in the neighborhood. The enemy were
camped just behind the hills on the other side.
Just about this time they appeared to be having a
religious revival. While visiting my sentinels
after dark, I could hear them preaching, praying,
and singing, whole regiments apparently being
thus engaged. Under orders from Corps headquarters
we refrained from firing upon their pickets
and they reciprocated the courtesy, which made it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
much pleasanter for the sentinels on both sides of
the river.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>With the Army of the Cumberland</i></h2>


<p>After two days of this picket duty we were relieved
by a Connecticut regiment and rejoined our
Corps. We found that we were under orders to
march the next day to Brandy Station, on the
railroad. We did not know it at the time, but
we were about to take our leave from the old Army
of the Potomac, with which we had been associated
since its organization. We had fought side
by side in some of the hardest battles in the war;
and had we been consulted in the matter, we
would doubtless have voted to stay where we
were, and help it to finish Lee's army. However,
we were not consulted, and the necessities of war
now called us to the Army of the Cumberland at
Chattanooga.</p>

<p>On the night of the 24th, we bivouacked at
Brandy Station, where the paymaster worked all
night paying off the troops, and where we saw the
Eleventh Corps being loaded for Alexandria.
The next morning we marched to Bealeton Station,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
where, after a wait of a day, we also loaded
up and started. The cars were ordinary freight
trucks, with rough board benches set crosswise,
and the men were crowded in as thick as they
could be seated.</p>

<p>We pulled out of Washington over the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio Railroad, the trains containing forty
or fifty cars each. As we approached the mountains
the size of the trains was reduced to about
seven cars; but on reaching the western slope, the
old number was restored. We crossed the Ohio
at Benwood, on a pontoon bridge. Another lot
of cars was awaiting us on the opposite side, and
we went on through Columbus, Dayton, Indianapolis,
and Louisville. On this trip through Ohio
and Indiana we were everywhere reminded that
we were among friends. Our train stopped for
a time at Columbus, Xenia, and Dayton, and it
seemed as though the citizens of those towns could
not do enough for us. At every station along the
road great crowds of people were gathered, and
cheered us as we passed along.</p>

<p>We stopped briefly at Louisville, then went on
again through Nashville, and past the battle-field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of Murfreesboro. We debarked from the cars at
Stevenson, Alabama, on Sunday morning, just a
week from the time we had started. We certainly
were glad enough to be released after seven
days and nights of railroad travelling, cramped up
so tightly that there was scarce room either to sit
up or lie down. Our arrival was none too soon.
The long line of railroad from Nashville southward,
had been practically unguarded, and the
enemy's cavalry under General Wheeler succeeded
soon after our arrival in tearing it up in several
places.</p>

<p>We now had several weeks of racing up and
down the railroad line, infantry after cavalry, and
with the usual result. In the end, however, the
road was cleared, with the whole "Red Star"
Division distributed between Murfreesboro and
Stevenson. Our Regiment was stationed at Wartrace,
where there was a junction with a short railroad
running to Shelbyville&mdash;the Nashville &amp;
Chattanooga Railroad. It was a curiosity. The
cross-ties were about five feet apart, and the rails
were of wood, surmounted by a running surface of
light iron. Frequently the wooden rails would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
spread, and then there would be a wreck; in fact,
scarcely a day passed on which there would not
be an accident of some kind. Large details of
men from our Regiment were set to work to bring
the road in repair, and by Christmas it was in fairly
good condition.</p>

<p>Shortly after we were established at Wartrace,
I secured leave of absence to go to Chattanooga in
search of my brother, who had enlisted in the
Tenth Wisconsin. I had not heard of him since
the battle of Chickamauga. My route was by
rail to Bridgeport on the Tennessee River, then in
a small captured Confederate steamer called
"Paint Rock," up the Tennessee to Chattanooga.</p>

<p>The "Paint Rock" was loaded to its utmost
capacity with hardtack for the starving Union
men who held Chattanooga. The river route to
that town had only recently been opened up by
General Hooker, with the Eleventh Corps and
the Second Division of our Corps. Previously it
had been necessary to wheel all supplies sixty
miles over a mountain road, where teams could
scarcely haul the forage for their own trip. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
now the boats could run only to within eight miles
of the city.</p>

<p>The fifty-mile river trip brought me at the end
of the day to the landing at Kelly's Ferry. Then
I had an eight-mile walk before me to the camps,
where I arrived late in the evening. I soon
found the regiment or the small remnant of it that
I was looking for; but then I learned that my
brother was beyond doubt a prisoner in the hands
of the enemy.</p>

<p>I spent a day in visiting about Chattanooga.
The enemy occupied a line from the Tennessee
River, above town, to the point of Lookout Mountain
below. At no place were they near enough
to throw shells into the city, save from their heavy
guns on Lookout Mountain. From these, shells
came over all day at intervals of ten or fifteen
minutes and exploded high in the air over either
our camps or the city. So far as I could see, however,
they did little damage.</p>

<p>Shortly after my return to my Regiment, I was
detailed to investigate the killing of a negro by a
white man, not far from our post. The evidence
showed that it was a most unprovoked murder, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
I so reported. The man was thereupon arrested
and sent to the provost marshal at Tullahoma. I
never learned what was finally done with him.
The curious thing about the affair was the frank
astonishment of the man that anyone should take
notice of the killing of a mere "nigger."</p>

<p>Toward the end of November a large number
of Confederate prisoners, who had been captured
in the battles of Lookout Mountain and Missionary
Ridge, were being sent northward over the
railroad. We often had conversation with them
while the trains were stopping at our station. Some
were still defiant, but most of them were discouraged,
and many predicted that the Confederacy
could not last six months longer. An unusually
large number of deserters of all ranks from colonel
downward, were also coming in, and they likewise
professed to believe that the Confederacy was
tottering.</p>

<h2><i>The Third Veteranizes</i></h2>


<p>In December a general order was issued from
the War Department, providing for the renlistment
of veteran regiments. It provided for a liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
bounty for all who renlisted as veterans after
two years' service; but it offered what was a
greater temptation than anything else, the chance
to go home for thirty days as a regiment, with the
opportunity to recruit up to the full standard. I
explained to my Company all the advantages of
this arrangement. Their term of service would
not expire until the end of June. By that time the
fighting would probably be well over with. By
renlisting now they would secure the bounty, the
thirty days furlough, and the honorable record of
veteran soldiers, and it would be possible to preserve
our organization from the beginning to the
end of the war.</p>

<p>Just about this time I was called away from
camp to Tullahoma, to sit on the court martial of
Colonel E. L. Price of the One Hundred Forty-Fifth
New York Regiment, on charges of misbehaviour
in battle. When the court adjourned
over the Christmas holidays and I returned to my
Regiment, I was informed by my First Sergeant
that the men of my Company had been talking over
the matter of renlisting, and that more than three-fourths
of them were ready to do so if I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
stay with them. The contagion spread. By
Christmas all but two of the officers, and 240 out
of 300 enlisted men present with the Regiment,
had, in the language of the day, "veteranized."</p>

<p>On Christmas this surviving remnant of the
thousand men of the Third, who had so gayly left
the State two-and-a-half years before, started on
their return. It was a beautiful day, and for us
one of perfect happiness. We were going home
with a record that none could surpass and few
commands could equal. We were the first regiment
from Wisconsin, and I believe the first in the
army, to renlist.</p>

<p>At Madison the arms were stored, and the men
scattered to their homes to enjoy their thirty-days'
furlough. I was just in time to take part in a New
Year's dance, and go home in the morning on the
coldest day ever known in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The month of January, 1864, which we spent
in Wisconsin, was a season of continuous festivities.
The only drawback was the extreme cold,
which to us who had just come from the South,
seemed more severe than it had ever been before.
Everyone seemed to be determined to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the returned soldiers the best time of their lives.
Some of the croakers thought it too gay for people
who were engaged in a death struggle for the life
of the Nation. Those of us, however, who had
been at the front, were disposed to be merry while
we could, and leave the future to care for itself.
Recruiting was going on all the time. Our veterans
proved the best recruiting officers in the State.
They brought in their brothers and cousins, schoolmates
and friends, so that when we were ready to
return once more to the south, we had added 300
men to our rolls, picked from the very flower of
Wisconsin's citizenry.</p>

<p>On February 2 the veterans of the Regiment assembled
at Madison. On the 4th we were again
on our way south, and reached Tullahoma the
night of the 9th. On the 12th we started out for
Fayetteville, the seat of Lincoln County, Tennessee,
where we arrived at noon on the following day.
On our way we passed through Lynchburg, where
there was pointed out to us the house, or rather the
ruins of the house, which was said to have been
the birthplace of Davy Crockett. At Mulberry,
a little farther on, I met a middle-aged citizen who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
said that he had never known what a United
States flag looked like until he had seen one carried
by our soldiers in this war.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>Reorganizing Lincoln County</i></h2>


<p>Lincoln County was one of the richest, as well
as the most violent of Secession counties in Tennessee.
Its people boasted that it had cast 2,500
votes for Secession, and not one for the Union;
the few Union men in the county had not dared to
go to the polls. A few months previous to our
coming a small detachment of Northern troops
had been captured there by guerrillas. The
prisoners had been taken to the bank of the Elk
River and three of them deliberately murdered.
A fourth had only escaped by leaping
into the river and swimming off in the confusion.
When he had reported the matter to headquarters,
Colonel Ketcham of the One Hundred Fiftieth
New York had been sent to collect an assessment
of $30,000 from the citizens of the county for the
benefit of the families of the murdered soldiers.</p>

<p>Our mission in Lincoln County was to hunt
down the guerrillas who infested it, and to care for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the refugees from Chattanooga and other places
in the rear of the army, who had lost their means of
gaining a livelihood. We supported the refugees
by forced levies of corn and bacon from the
wealthy planters of the vicinity, while our
mounted force soon disposed of the guerrillas,
capturing a number and frightening the rest out
of the county. We had a novel way of administering
justice. For instance, about two months
after our arrival a number of these young offenders,
whose parents lived in the vicinity and were substantial
farmers, stole from a citizen mules valued
at $400. The Colonel immediately assessed the
amount on the fathers, and with the money thus
collected paid for the mules. That was our policy
all through&mdash;to make the wealthy Confederates
pay for the damage done by their lawless
colleagues. And this method had a good effect,
for it soon put an end to the thievery.</p>

<p>Shortly after we arrived, our mounted men captured
a Confederate officer named Boone, a grandson
of the famous Daniel. On him was found a
list of all the guerrillas in the county. When I examined
him, he told me that he had been sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
muster these fellows into the Confederate army;
but his plans were spoiled. Instead he went to
Johnson's Island, a prisoner, and his little memorandum
book remained in my possession.</p>

<p>Among the names on the list were those of two
Miller boys, whose mother and sister lived in town.
The Captain of our mounted men, and several
other officers, boarded with the family, for the
people in Fayetteville were usually glad to take
in Union officers as boarders, in order that they
might secure from our rations the otherwise unobtainable
luxuries of sugar and coffee. Several
days after the capture of Boone's list, the Captain
brought in both of the young Millers as prisoners.
They were forwarded to Corps headquarters
at Tullahoma. The elder, instead of being sent
North as a prisoner of war, was tried by court
martial and sentenced to be hanged in the public
square of Fayetteville. That did not suit some
of us; so we found means to send Mrs. Miller
to Shelbyville, where she secured Judge Cooper,
a well-known Unionist and former member of
Congress, to go to Washington, and lay the case
before President Lincoln. It was well known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
that no death sentence was ever executed with the
President's consent, if there was any reasonable excuse
for avoiding it. His usual magnanimity did
not fail in this case, and the boy was sent North
as an ordinary prisoner of war.</p>

<p>When the President's amnesty proclamation
was issued, we were given the duty of reorganizing
Lincoln County under its provisions. I was appointed
provost marshal, and in that position administered
oaths of allegiance to several thousand
repentant and unrepentant Secessionists. When
the election was held, returns were made to me,
and by me tabulated, and sent to the military
governor at Nashville. Commissions were then
issued by him to the officials who had been elected,
so that when we left, the county was ready to resume
civil government.</p>

<p>In administering the oath of allegiance, the demand
for blanks was so great that the ordinary
sources could not furnish a sufficient supply. It
was necessary, therefore, for me to open a printing
office. So I took possession of an old printing establishment,
and set several men to work. The
press was broken down and the type badly "pi'd";<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
but we soon had the machinery repaired, and by
combining the stock of three printing offices, secured
sufficient type to run our establishment with
success.</p>

<p>In addition to these other duties, I had to listen
to everyone in the county who sought redress for a
grievance of any kind. Some had had horses
taken by our army, or by bushwhackers; some had
been robbed of money or other valuables; some
wanted permits to carry firearms, which were of
course never granted; and others needed assistance
from the Government to keep from starving. One
man came with a case parallel to that of the
woman who wanted a "pass to raise geese." He
wanted a "pass to raise a crup." I told him to go
on and raise his crop, or do whatever he pleased,
so long as he remained loyal to the Government.
He said his neighbors had told him he could not
raise a crop without a permit from the Federals,
and that every man who took the oath of allegiance
was branded in the forehead with the letters
"U. S."</p>

<p>One day a woman came to me, who said she
had heard that we paid $10,000 to the widows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
men killed by guerrillas. I explained to her that
we had done that only for the widows of three
Union soldiers. I told her, however, that if she
could give me any information about where the
guerrillas could be found, we would capture and
punish them. She said she did not know, but that
she had heard some shots in the woods. She had
not seen her man since, and she was sure they had
killed him. After parleying awhile she started
out of the door. But before she went out, she
turned and called back to me, "That ai'nt the
wust of 't; they stole my old mare, too!"</p>

<p>When we first arrived at Fayetteville not a person
was to be seen on the streets, although before
the war it had been a place of 2,000 inhabitants.
There was not a vestige of any kind of business
left in the town. Even the stores and taverns were
vacant. The people soon made their appearance,
however, when they found that we had come to
stay, and before very long we had established the
most friendly relations with them. By the time we
were ready to leave, almost every family in town
had its friends among the soldiers. They were
very sociable, and always seemed glad to have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Federal officers call on them. The young ladies
would sing and play the piano beautifully, and
make things quite homelike for us after the routine
of the day's work. Twenty years later, while
passing through Fayetteville on my way to Atlanta,
I received courtesies from a citizen who only
knew me by reputation as one of the officers of the
Third Wisconsin.</p>

<p>It was curious to see what a difference slavery
had made in the social life of these people. Everywhere
work was considered disgraceful for a
white man, and as only the occupation of the
"nigger." In order to succeed socially, it was
necessary to own slaves. The idea of hiring
labor, or of being rich without negroes, was apparently
incomprehensible. And in fact it was
true that all of the people who had obtained any
sort of success, intellectually or otherwise, had
owned slaves.</p>

<p>Most of the men who resided in the vicinity had
served in the Confederate army. Some had been
discharged on account of wounds or sickness, while
others, and probably most of them, had deserted
when they became sure that the fight was hopeless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>My office was a common resort for these people
after they had taken the oath of amnesty. They
would sit around by the hour, and spin their yarns
about the Confederate service. The recent deserters
had to be sent to headquarters at Tullahoma for
examination; and as we could communicate only
with a strong escort, I would sometimes have half
a dozen of them paroled to report to me daily until
I could arrange to send on a party.</p>

<p>In all my dealings with these people, I found
scarcely any who really desired the success of the
Union cause. There were plenty of them, probably
the majority, who thought the Confederacy a
failure, and wished to get back into the Union on
the best possible terms; but they still clung to their
old ideas. However, that did not interfere with
our friendship and the good time that we had
while we were there. And when the day at
length came when we were obliged to leave, I
think that they really were, as they professed to be,
sorry at our going. And well they might be, for
the regiment of Tennessee Union Cavalry, that
occupied the town after we left, proceeded at once
to kill several of the most prominent men who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
not taken the amnesty oath, and at least one who
had.</p>

<p>On the morning of April 28, 1864, we said
farewell to our Fayetteville friends and started out
on the campaign which a year later was to end at
Raleigh, North Carolina, with the surrender of
Johnston's army and the end of the war. With us
was a company of Tennessee Union Cavalry, commanded
by Captain Brixey, which had been sent
to Lincoln County to hunt bushwhackers. On
leaving Fayetteville they had taken a horse belonging
to Judge Chilcote, a prominent citizen,
who had been of much assistance to me in the
provost marshal's office in restoring civil government,
and who had at the election been chosen
county clerk. The Judge followed us, and asked
to have his horse restored. Colonel Hawley of
our Regiment at once compelled Captain Brixey to
give it up. He did so with apparent reluctance,
and then secretly sent a number of his men over a
by-road to intercept the Judge on his return and
kill him. This cowardly deed accomplished, the
men rejoined their command. Brixey then pushed
on ahead to Tullahoma, and on the next day left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
for the mountains of East Tennessee. The murder
was reported to us that night. The Colonel
sent back Captain Gardner with his mounted men
to investigate, but the murderers had fled as soon
as their deed became known, and nothing more
could be done. After this outrage, Brixey never
dared to rejoin our army. Some time later he
was killed by Confederates in northwestern
Georgia.</p>

<p>During our stay at Fayetteville our Corps and
the old Eleventh of the Army of the Potomac
were consolidated, and became known as the
Twentieth Corps of the Army of the Cumberland.
The command was given to General Hooker.
Our portion of the army would very much have
preferred General H. W. Slocum, who was sent
to Vicksburg. In the reorganization we became
the Second Brigade of the First Division, with
General Thomas H. Ruger commanding the
Brigade and General A. S. Williams commanding
the Division. At the suggestion of the officers
of the Eleventh Corps, our old badge, the five-pointed
star, was retained as the badge of the new
corps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>Opening of the Atlanta Campaign</i></h2>


<p>Our Regiment reached Tullahoma on April 30,
to find that the rest of our Brigade had already
gone to the front. We started out on the next day
to join them, and on May 4 crossed the Tennessee
River at Bridgeport. On the 7th we passed over
the battle-field of Chickamauga, where signs of the
conflict were still everywhere in evidence. On
the night of the 8th we crossed the mountains by
way of Nickajack Pass, and joined our Brigade
at daylight the next morning. This passage over
the mountains was interesting. The night was extremely
dark and perfectly quiet. The men in
charge of the wagon train had placed lighted
candles on the rocks along the road, at intervals of
about a hundred feet, in order to guide themselves
and those who came after. These were still flickering
when we came along.</p>

<p>Our march to Atlanta was now well under way.
The enemy continually fell back, and in most
cases without offering serious resistance. The
three armies of General Sherman, marching in
parallel lines, seemed to be able to carry everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
before them. On the 10th we again
crossed the mountains at Snake Creek Gap, going
into camp on the other side until the 13th. On
the night of the 10th we were visited by a tremendous
wind and rain storm, which blew down
our tents, and raised the water in the creek so high
that we had to move our camp or be drowned.
At about this time, also, an order was read to the
troops announcing the great success of the Army of
the Potomac in the opening battles of the final
campaign against Richmond.</p>

<p>On the 14th we were moved to the extreme left
to support General Howard, who was there engaged
with the enemy. We arrived at about
sundown, just as the Confederates were driving in
a brigade of the Fourth Corps and threatening to
capture a battery of artillery. As we moved forward
in line of battle, ready to receive the advancing
enemy, General Williams called out to the
fleeing soldiers of the Fourth Corps to get back
out of the way, for he had a division there from
the Army of the Potomac that would protect them.
All of which goes to show that even major-generals
are human, and when they get a chance like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to exult over their rivals. We checked the advance
of the enemy without much trouble.</p>

<p>At about noon on the 15th, General Butterfield,
with our Third Division, moved forward to attack
an earthwork and a four-gun battery, which the
enemy held in his front. We moved forward on
the left to support him; and encountering little opposition
at first, advanced somewhat farther than
the Third Division. We took position in the edge
of a woods, where we made use of a rail fence and
some logs to build a breastwork in anticipation of
an attack, which the skirmish firing in front warned
us was coming. We soon had sight of the advancing
enemy. A few volleys from us, however,
and they broke and ran. In a short time
they again came up, with a new line. We disposed
of that almost as quickly as the first. A
third time they repeated the attempt, and again we
beat them back.</p>

<p>Now came the order to pursue. My Company,
and the companies on my right, moved forward
about two hundred yards in the woods. Suddenly
we found that we were on the flank of a
Brigade that was still stubbornly fighting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
troops of the Twenty-Third Corps and the left
companies of our Regiment. They were in a
peach orchard, the nearest of them not fifty yards
away. I hastily wheeled my Company, and
Company H to the left, and opened fire. At such
short range, and in such a crowd, every shot must
have counted. The Confederates did not wait
for much, but skedaddled as fast as their legs could
carry them.</p>

<p>Just as the last of them were disappearing from
sight, I saw a man in Confederate uniform come
running toward my Company, hatless, but with gun
in hand. I supposed that he was coming in to
give himself up. He came within twenty yards
of us, then apparently noticed for the first time
that we were Yankees. He immediately started
to run back. I called to him to surrender, but it
only increased his speed. Finding that he did
not stop, two of my men fired at him, and both hit
him. He fell dead almost instantly upon the
field. I went forward then and examined him.
He was a mere boy, not over twenty years of age.
In his pocket we found his order, not two weeks
old, from the conscript officer of his district, notifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
him to join the army. I have seen fields of
battle in front of our Regiment, covered over with
the dead, without experiencing the pang of regret
that I felt for this poor lad who, scarcely out from
home, and too frightened and confused to know
what to do, thus sadly met his fate.</p>

<p>The loss of our Regiment in this fight was one
killed and thirty-one wounded. Many of the
wounded subsequently died, among them Reverend
John M. Springer, the Chaplain of the
Regiment. When drafted in 1863, he had been
a Methodist minister in Monroe, Wisconsin. Believing
this to be a call of duty he had refused to
allow his church to secure a substitute, and had reported
at Madison for service. When our Regiment
was about to leave Wisconsin for the front,
after the veteran furlough, we officers had been introduced
to him in the Executive Chamber at the
Capitol, where we had assembled on the invitation
of the Governor. When sent for, Springer had
been found doing sentinel duty before the gate of
Camp Randall. We had elected him Chaplain,
and he had joined us at Fayetteville as soon as he
could secure his discharge as a private. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
morning of the battle, when the prospects seemed
good for a lively fight, he had come to me and
asked for a musket and some ammunition, for he
did not wish to be lurking in the rear while we
were in danger at the front. At my suggestion,
he had previously posted himself in the tactics, so I
now told him to take the place of a Lieutenant in
my Company. He was the first man hit, and died
in the hospital a few days later.</p>

<p>By a strange coincidence, our picket found on
the field in our front the dead body of the Chaplain
of the Georgia Regiment with which we had
been engaged. We were told by some of the
wounded prisoners that he had been shot in coming
up to recover the body of his son, a captain in the
Regiment, who had been killed early in the fight.</p>

<p>In this battle, for the first time in my experience,
Confederate soldiers who might have escaped
came in and gave themselves up as prisoners. I
think as many as forty did this. They were all
thoroughly discouraged, and the same feeling
seems to have run through their whole army, for
they were more quickly and easily beaten than I
had ever seen them before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>It was understood on our part that in order to
give the Army of the Tennessee time to get below
Resaca and cut off their retreat, we were not to
push the attack against the enemy. They were
too quick for us, however; the next morning they
had abandoned Resaca, leaving behind them six
heavy guns and large quantities of provisions and
ammunition.</p>

<p>On the 19th we came up to them again at Cassville,
where we drove them into their entrenched
lines and occupied the town. We expected a
fight in the morning, but once more they were gone,
this time across the Etowah River. After a rest
of four days at Cassville, we again went forward,
crossing the Etowah on a pontoon bridge without
resistance.</p>

<p>On the 25th we had nearly reached Dallas
when we were turned back to assist General
Geary, who had encountered a division of Hood's
Corps, entrenched on the Marietta road to our left,
at a place called New Hope Church. On our
arrival we found that Geary's Division had already
pushed back the enemy's skirmishers until
the latter were thought to be in their main line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
works, from which position we were ordered to
drive them. The country was heavily timbered,
and underbrush so obscured the view that it was
impossible to see in any direction more than a few
rods. When we came within sight of the enemy
we found that a six-gun battery was posted a little
in front of their line of infantry. The latter
awaited us behind a breastwork, evidently hastily
constructed of logs and earth, nevertheless affording
fairly good shelter. As soon as we came
within range, the battery opened on us with round
shot and shell; then, as we came nearer, with
grape and canister. But we pushed steadily on
until we were less than sixty yards from them,
when we halted; for we had lost so many men,
and had become so disorganized in the march
through the timber and brush that the impetus of
our charge was gone. The regiments on both
sides of us had already done the same. We
sheltered ourselves as well as we could, behind
trees and fallen timber, and opened fire on their
battery, receiving a hot fire in return from their
infantry. We succeeded, however, in driving off
the Confederate gunners, and prevented the cannon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
from being worked for the remainder of the
day.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>Wounded and in Hospital</i></h2>


<p>When we had first come within range of the
grape-shot, my scabbard had been struck and cut
in two at a point just below where I grasped it
with my left hand. Later, when my men had
sheltered themselves and had commenced firing,
I was again struck. I was at the time resting on
one knee in a position where I could watch the
battery, and direct our fire upon it, for I was determined
that the enemy should not have an opportunity
to take it away so long as we had a
chance to capture it. My attention had just been
called to something on the left, when a bullet
struck the front of my cap, cutting the figure "3"
out of the bugle, and glancing from the bone, cut
a gash across my forehead. For a time I lost all
interest in that battle. When I regained my feet,
Colonel Hawley, who was standing near, told me
to get back to the hospital. I succeeded in finding
my way to a small ravine that we had crossed,
thinking as I got back of the line, that there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a thousand bullets flying, to every one nearer
the front. At the small brook in the ravine, I
tried to wash off the blood which was blinding
me, but had such poor success that I concluded
to follow the Colonel's advice and have the wound
dressed. I considered it not much of a clip, and
thought that in three days at the most I would be
back with my company. It was about two months
before I rejoined, and a good many years before I
entirely recovered.</p>

<p>On my way back to the hospital, I met in succession
General Williams who commanded the
Division, General Hooker who commanded the
Corps, General Thomas who commanded the
Army of the Cumberland, and General Sherman
who commanded the Department. Each
stopped and asked if I was much hurt&mdash;when I
told that it was only a scratch, they were eager
for information as to the situation at the front. I
explained that we had driven the artillerymen
from their guns, but that the infantry in their
breastworks had been too much for us. Then each
kindly told me to go to the hospital.</p>

<p>At the hospital I found Dr. Conley, our Regimental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Surgeon, who dressed my wound and gave
me a blanket to lie down on. I got away to one
side and tried to sleep, but the Doctor disturbed me
so often to look at my wound that this was impossible.
I finally lost all patience with him and
ordered him to let me alone; but he afterwards explained
that he feared I would go to sleep and
wake up in the next world.</p>

<p>This fight is known in the North as the Battle
of Dallas, or the Battle of Pumpkinvine Creek, and
in the South as the Battle of New Hope Church.
In the engagement, our Regiment lost eighteen
men killed and ninety-two wounded. This loss
was quite unevenly distributed among the companies.
Mine had sixteen men severely wounded,
two of whom subsequently died. Company A,
on my left, had six men killed and twenty-one
wounded. Captain Hunter of Company F was
wounded by a canister shot, in one of his legs near
the knee-joint, and died shortly after. Captain
Ruger of the Brigade staff also received a severe
wound in the knee, which incapacitated him for
further service during the war.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the day following the battle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
I thought I was strong enough to go back to my
Regiment. So I started out, against the protests of
the surgeons; but after going about a quarter of a
mile, my legs gave out, and I was obliged to return
and obey directions. I remained at the field hospital
for about three and a half days. During
most of that time the surgeons were busy at the
amputating table. On the morning of the 29th all
of the slightly wounded were sent off with the
wagon train. The more seriously wounded were
sent off late in the afternoon in the ambulances.
Captains Hunter, Ruger, and I went in the same
ambulance, I was on the seat with the driver.</p>

<p>At Kingston, where we arrived on the 30th,
a long train of freight cars for the slightly
wounded, and hospitals cars for the severely
wounded was waiting, ready to start for Chattanooga.
Captain Hunter was, however, too ill to
go, and I would not leave him, so we waited over
together until June 2. The ride to Chattanooga
was a very severe one for poor Hunter, and he appeared
to be much the worse for it. He recovered
temporarily under the careful treatment at Chattanooga,
of Doctor Persons of the First Wisconsin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Cavalry, but on June 8 began to sink rapidly, and
died on the afternoon of the following day.</p>

<p>My wound was not dangerous, yet it was serious
enough to entitle me to a leave of absence. I
took advantage of it to return for a pleasant week
to my Wisconsin home; then rejoined my Regiment
near the Chattahoochee River on July 17.
During my absence it had followed the fortunes
of the Twentieth Corps, having had no hard fighting
and but few casualties on the picket line. The
term of service of the men who had not renlisted
had expired on June 29, and they had been mustered
out. The officers in the various regiments,
however, who wished to be mustered out, found
themselves conscripted for a longer term. Their
applications had been approved until they had
reached General Thomas; but he had forwarded
them to Washington with recommendations for
dishonorable discharge. Discovering this danger,
the officers had withdrawn their applications. A
number in the Twenty-Ninth Pennsylvania had,
however, been dishonorably discharged under
such circumstances, and at the time this seemed to
us an injustice.</p>

<h2><i>The Siege of Atlanta</i></h2>


<p>On the day that I rejoined the Regiment the
army moved forward across the Chattahoochee
River. During the next three days a farther advance
was made across Peach Tree Creek, and
we were now but a few miles from the fortifications
of Atlanta. On the afternoon of the 20th,
General Hood, the new Confederate commander
who had succeeded Johnston, came out of his entrenchments
and made a furious attack on our
lines. The brunt of it fell on our Corps, which
was somewhat in advance of the others. Our
Regiment being in the second line was not engaged,
for the first line repulsed the enemy along
the entire front. The fighting was very severe,
the Confederates coming up to the attack again
and again. The loss in our Corps was about
2,000 killed and wounded; that of the enemy
must have been double that number.</p>

<p>On the night of the 21st I went on picket duty
with instructions to advance my picket line if possible,
for the enemy's pickets were so close that
their stray bullets were causing much annoyance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
in our camp. We were not very successful during
the night; but in the morning, when the whole
Brigade picket line under Major Smith of the
One Hundred Fiftieth New York, moved forward,
the enemy had disappeared. As was now
becoming quite usual, a number of their men remained
behind to be taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Major Smith's orders were to advance until he
found the enemy. So we slowly pushed forward
through their strong but abandoned works, and encountered
no serious opposition until within about
a mile of their fortifications immediately surrounding
the city. We met their picket line on a hill,
and drove it back a half mile, but they brought
out against us such a strong force that we in turn
were obliged to fall back, taking our stand on the
hills where we had first met their pickets. From
this position they did not seriously attempt to dislodge
us.</p>

<p>From our vantage we could see all of their
man&oelig;uvers. Apparently there were not more
than 2,000 or 3,000 troops to prevent our entry
into the city. I have always believed that if there
had been someone high enough in command to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
have used the troops where I was that day, Atlanta
could have been captured much more easily
than it was six weeks later. At about six o'clock
our Corps came up, and our picket line, once more
moving forward, drove the Confederate skirmishers
to within two hundred yards of their forts.</p>

<p>The next day a battery of twenty-pound <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'parrot'">Parrott</ins>
guns was planted on the hill and commenced
throwing shells into the city over our heads. The
enemy replied with spirit, and we received many
of their compliments that were intended for the
battery. Our men protected themselves by throwing
up an earthwork in front of the camp, with a
ditch behind it wide enough and deep enough to
shelter all in case of necessity. The officers all
had heavy earth barricades built in front of their
tents, and these furnished fairly good protection.</p>

<p>I remember to have been one night in the Colonel's
tent when the shells were flying pretty
lively. We were just discussing whether his embankment
would stop a shell, when one came
along and buried itself in the ground a little in
front without exploding. The Colonel went out
and found that it had gone two feet into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
ground. One of the other officers present expressed
the opinion that it would have gone
through the breastwork if it had struck properly.
The words were scarcely out of his mouth when
another shell struck the work, penetrating about
two-thirds of the way, and exploding without
damage.</p>

<p>At another time we were not so fortunate. A
shell struck the barricade of Captain Orton of
Company K, passed through, and exploded in the
tent, mortally wounding him and seriously wounding
Lieutenants Barager, Blanchard, and
Schweers, who were with him. Lieutenant Barager
served until the end of the war; but a few
years after its close, he became, as a consequence
of that shock, a physical and mental wreck.</p>

<p>The enemy's sharpshooters were close enough
to us to keep dropping their bullets incessantly
into our camp. It was at first rather annoying to
have them come pattering around whenever anyone
moved, but in time we became so accustomed
to the missiles, that we went about our ordinary
business as though there were no Confederates
within forty miles. On one occasion the Thirteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
New Jersey went out in front of the line and
captured thirty-five of the enemy's pickets, and
burned the houses where the marksmen had been
stationed.</p>

<p>On July 28 General Hooker was at his own
request relieved of the command of our Corps.
He had taken offence at being jumped by General
Howard for the command of the Army of the
Tennessee, after the death of General McPherson
in the battle of July 22. I do not believe that
the highest officers generally sympathized with
Hooker, but the Corps as a whole felt that his loss
was a serious blow. He had large personal influence
on his troops. During an active campaign,
virtually every soldier in his Corps saw him almost
daily. If there was a picket line to be established,
he personally examined it; if an assault was
made on the enemy, he was with the foremost, always
brave to the extreme of recklessness. He
was, moreover, careful of the welfare of his men.
He made his commissaries attend strictly to business,
and his Corps would often be furnished with
the delicacies of army rations when others were
short or had nothing but hardtack and salt pork.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
It was a common remark all through the army
that Joe Hooker fed his men the best, and fought
them the best, of any of the corps commanders.
Of course his men worshipped him and under him
were invincible; for the same reason the enemy
dreaded him worse than anything else mortal.</p>

<p>The newspapers of the day said that the appointment
of General Howard was the work of
President Lincoln. But it was reported in the
Corps, that General Sherman had been the prime
mover. It was freely whispered among us that
Sherman, with all his great talents and acknowledged
ability, was affected with the same weakness
that was said to have troubled Napoleon&mdash;the
not being able to look with complacency on the
great personal popularity of a subordinate. Sherman
was reported to have allowed this feeling to
break forth into positive insult of General Hooker
and his Corps in the presence of subordinates.
For instance, on the night after the battle of Peach
Tree Creek, before any returns of casualties had
been made, Hooker told Sherman that he had
lost that day nearly 2,000 men. "Oh pshaw!"
answered Sherman, "that's nothing; they'll all be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
back in the morning." Later it was found that
1,700 members of the Corps had been killed or
wounded, and that they had successfully repulsed
the whole Confederate army with a reported loss
to the latter of 6,000.</p>

<p>Before leaving, General Hooker invited all the
colonels in the Corps to call on him, and told
them frankly his reasons for resigning. He said
that during the whole campaign he had been subjected
to unbearable insults and indignities, and
his Corps and its performances had been underrated
and disparaged. And now, to have promoted
over him a junior officer from this Department,
whose rank and service were far below his,
was the last straw; his reputation as a soldier and
his honor as a man would not, he said, admit of his
remaining.</p>

<p>The enemy's picket line had been temporarily
quieted by the advance of the Thirteenth New
Jersey, but was now again annoying us. These
pickets were on a ridge about two hundred yards
in front of their main line of works, and not more
than four hundred yards from our camp. They
had lines of pits dug all along their position and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
could at any time communicate with their main
line. Our pickets were also located in pits, but
could only be relieved at night. It was determined
to reverse this order of things. So at daylight
on July 30, at a preconcerted signal, our
whole Brigade picket line, under command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Morse of the Second Massachusetts,
jumped out of their pits, crossed the intervening
space at a run, and captured the enemy's
entire line, numbering seven officers and ninety-seven
men.</p>

<p>A regiment was immediately sent out to renforce
our men, and breastworks were hastily
thrown up. From their forts and main breastworks,
the enemy poured into us a shower of shot
and shell; but our men held their position all day,
many of them firing as much as two hundred
rounds of ammunition. At night the position was
made impregnable against anything save a movement
in large force; and in the morning the enemy
were compelled to withdraw their artillery
and close the embrasures of their forts.</p>

<p>For some weeks there was not much change in
the situation, so far as we were concerned. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
was much hard work for the men in the trenches,
and they were all getting anxious for the capture
of Atlanta. I believe nine-tenths of them would
rather have fought the matter out in an open battle
than to have kept on scraping and shoveling
to dig them out. It seemed to us at the time that
between our army and that of the Confederates,
there had been enough dirt dug, from Louisville
to Atlanta, to have built all the railroads in the
United States.</p>

<p>For a time in our advanced position, firing on
the picket line was constant, and there were many
casualties. In a week or two, however, a sort of
truce was established, and firing ceased. Just before
I had rejoined my Regiment on the Chattahoochee,
our pickets had been quite friendly with
the pickets of the enemy. They had traded coffee
for tobacco, and had offered to take letters and
send them to Union prisoners in their hands. I
should at this time have liked to send a letter to my
brother. But now they would not go as far as
that; nothing would induce them to meet us between
the picket lines for trading; to all our advances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
they replied that their orders forbade them
to do so.</p>

<p>On August 25 important changes were made
in the disposition of our troops. Our Corps was
withdrawn from before Atlanta and moved back
to the Chattahoochee River. The rest of the
army was moved around to the south of Atlanta,
temporarily abandoning its communications; this
was in order, by threatening his flank, to compel
Hood to come out of his works and fight us in the
open.</p>

<p>Throughout that day our heavy guns poured a
constant stream of shot and shell into the city. As
soon as darkness had settled down on the camps,
we silently folded our tents and moved back. I
had been on picket duty that night; it was still and
clear, and the slightest sound could be heard at a
great distance. As I passed along the picket line,
from man to man, and gave them the word to follow
instructions&mdash;which were for each man, as I
passed him, to leave his post and go back silently
to the rear&mdash;I could hear the Confederates changing
their relief just a little in my front. In one case
I heard the old sentinel tell the new one to "keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
a sharp watch on those Yanks over there," for
they were up to something and he believed they
were going to attack.</p>

<p>At the railroad bridge over the Chattahoochee,
where we took position, earthworks had already
been built. We strengthened them and built new
ones, so that by the night of the 26th we were
in condition to fight the whole of Hood's army.
Hood was, however, too busy south of Atlanta,
where Sherman now was, to trouble us; and we
had several days of complete quiet. It was a great
relief, after our experiences in the trenches, to be
able to walk around without hearing the bullets
whistle about our ears. Not the least of our enjoyment
was, to have a good river close at hand to
bathe in.</p>

<p>During our stay here, General Slocum arrived
and took command of the Corps. When he made
his first tour around the camp, he was given a royal
reception by his old command. They had all
been anxious to have as their leader someone who
had been identified with them in the Army of the
Potomac. With that army they had won their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
laurels, and they wished still to be known as a
part of it.</p>

<p>Slocum was a very different type of man from
Hooker. The latter was brilliant and dashing,
and in the excitement of battle his ardor and personal
courage carried him where the fire was
hottest. Slocum, on the contrary, reminded one of
the descriptions of Marlborough. Cool and unimpassioned
he directed a battle as he would a review.
Without particularly avoiding danger, he
would not rush recklessly into it. Hooker was an
inveterate boaster. Slocum usually said nothing.
I think most men would have considered Hooker
the better leader, and Slocum the better man.</p>

<p>Late on the night of September 1, while I was
on picket duty, I heard in the direction of Atlanta
what I at first thought was artillery. The rumbling
kept increasing in intensity until it seemed
like the heaviest firing I had ever heard. Finally,
a number of terrific explosions lit up the air. At
six miles distance they seemed like bright flashes
of lightning. I knew then that the enemy were
blowing up their powder magazines. I supposed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
however, that Sherman was fighting his way into
Atlanta from the south.</p>

<p>At daylight a reconnoitering party was sent out
toward the city. They found it evacuated, except
for a small rear guard of cavalry which was
soon driven out. The remainder of the Corps
moved up in the afternoon, our Regiment reaching
the city at about dark. Sherman's flanking movement
had been completely successful. He had
met Hood on the Macon Railroad, near Jonesboro,
and had beaten him terribly. The Confederate
commander had been obliged to evacuate Atlanta
at once, blowing up eighty cars of ammunition
which had been cut off by the capture of the
railroad at Jonesboro. He had been compelled to
destroy, also, the large rolling mill of the city,
which was said to have been the only mill in the
South where plating for gunboats could be manufactured.</p>

<p>We found more Union sentiment in Atlanta
than anywhere else in the South. As our Brigade
entered the city, at about nine o'clock at night,
many of the women brought out buckets of water
for us to drink. They were very bitter against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Hood's army, which they said had robbed them
of everything that could be carried off, with the
excuse that the Yankees would steal it anyway.
They were agreeably disappointed to find that the
Yankees did not rob them of a thing.</p>

<p>Immense quantities of tobacco were abandoned
by the Secessionist citizens who left town. This
fact ruined the sutlers' trade in that article. On
the day before Atlanta fell, tobacco sold in our
camps at a dollar a plug, and fifteen cents for cigars.
On the day after, plug tobacco passed about
for five cents, and cigars were twenty-five cents a
hundred. Our men found tobacco in every conceivable
place. One lot of twenty boxes was dug
out from under a big ash-heap. It was, however,
the only plunder obtained, for the most stringent
orders were issued against pillaging occupied
houses.</p>

<p>The effects of the Union bombardment could
everywhere be seen in the city. Almost every
house had the marks on it of shot and shell. One
man showed me a dozen shells that had struck in
his garden. The families remaining in the city had
all built in their yards bombproofs, to which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
had fled for safety whenever the shelling was in
progress.</p>

<p>On September 6 Sherman's army came back
from Jonesboro, and went into camp in the vicinity
of town. For a time we enjoyed the luxury of
complete rest, after our four months of continuous
campaigning. On September 23 our Regiment
received from Wisconsin 200 fresh recruits, who
had just been secured under the draft. Every one
was a substitute, and a splendid lot of men they
were physically, representing almost every nation
in Europe&mdash;English, Irish, Scotch, Welsh, Germans,
French, Norwegians, and I don't know
how many others. Some of them could not speak
a word of English. Over a dozen were full-blooded
Chippewa Indians, who until they put on
the uniforms of the United States Army, had
never worn the clothing of civilized people. They
were all excellent raw material, and in the course
of time made good soldiers. I recall only two of
the entire 200 who deserted.</p>

<p>About the first of October, Hood set out on his
trip to the North, in the attempt to starve us out of
Atlanta. On October 3 Sherman started after him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
with all of the army except our Corps, which was
left to hold the town. Our camps were now
changed around so as to defend the city on a
shorter line. Our Brigade was moved from the
south to the northwest side, and set to work to
build new breastworks, or rather to rebuild the old
ones of the Confederates.</p>

<p>The enemy succeeded in getting upon our railroad
to the North, and for about twenty days we
were completely cut off without news or provisions.
However, they had left us the whole of the country
southward to forage in; and this, together with
the rice we had captured in the city, and the "beef
dried on the hoof," as the men called the cattle
that were driven in, kept us a long way from starving.
Every week our forage trains would run out
into the country to the south, and gather in from
500 to 700 wagon-loads of corn, besides living,
while they were out, on the best that the land
afforded. Moreover, we had our provisions all to
ourselves; for on September 10 Sherman had ordered
all the citizens of the town to leave either to
the North or to the South.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>On October 11 our Regiment went out for the
first time on a foraging expedition. There were
2,500 men in the detachment, and a train of about
500 wagons. About fifteen miles south of Atlanta
we found plenty of corn for the animals;
and for the men, abundance of sweet potatoes and
other dainties not laid down in the army menu.
In two days we had our wagons laden with all
that could be hauled away. About a fortnight
later we went out again and brought in over 800
wagons of corn.</p>

<p>The forage which we thus gathered was the
salvation of our animals and beef cattle. The
mules had been on half rations of grain all summer,
quite without hay, and the whole country in
the vicinity of Atlanta had been grazed over until
it was as bare as a city street. The beeves that
had been driven down from Louisville, had for
weeks nothing to eat save the leaves and sprouts
on the bushes. It was a standing joke among the
men that the commissary always killed for beef
those animals that could not survive until the next
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>The March to the Sea</i></h2>


<p>On October 29 came the first through trains
from Chattanooga, after the movement of Hood to
the North. On the same day came orders to reduce
baggage and prepare for marching. Soon,
rumors were spreading about the camp that we
were to start on a fifty days' campaign, without
communications. On November 4 we were ready
to move. I wrote numerous letters of good-bye to
friends at home, telling them that they would
hear from me next at Charleston or Savannah. I
hoped that it would be Charleston, for I wanted
the people of South Carolina who started the war
to feel its effects and to reap their share of the horrors.</p>

<p>On November 5 we started out and marched
three miles from town. The next day, however,
we returned in order to wait until the Army of the
Tennessee might be paid off. This gave us a
chance to vote in the Presidential election, which
we had come very near missing. Our Regiment
gave Lincoln 304 votes and McClellan 21. For
another full week we remained in Atlanta, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Regiment being occupied the entire time in tearing
up railroad tracks and destroying everything
of value in the city. By the time we were ready
to leave, Atlanta was worth little more to the Confederates
than any other piece of ground of similar
size. On November 15 we started out in earnest
on the now famous "March to the Sea." Our
last view of Atlanta, the prize for which we had
so long struggled, was a column of dense smoke
from its burning buildings; we had destroyed
everything in town except the churches and private
residences.</p>

<p>Our expedition numbered about 50,000 men,
under the command of Sherman. Thomas's army
remained behind to look after Hood. We took
with us only about twenty days' rations, for the
country through which we passed was expected
to furnish the remainder of our needs. The army
proceeded in two columns&mdash;the right wing under
Howard making for Macon; the left under Slocum
making for Augusta. Each corps, also,
took a different route in order to be able to subsist
more easily on the country.</p>

<p>Our Corps proceeded along the Augusta railroad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
which we destroyed as we went along by
burning the ties and twisting the heated rails.
Parts of the country were poor and furnished little
forage. Other portions, however, compensated
by giving us an abundance of sweet potatoes and
pork, with occasional lots of corn meal, flour, and
sorghum, and, for the first arrivals on the plantation,
chickens and turkeys. On our route we
found plenty of good horses and mules, and all
the forage that we could carry off. Occasionally,
also the enterprising forager would capture some
apple-jack or corn whiskey.</p>

<p>At Madison we turned and took the road to
Milledgeville, the capital of Georgia. Geary's
Division, however, followed up the railroad to the
Oconee River, and destroyed the Oconee bridge.
We entered Milledgeville on the 22nd without
opposition, and camped in the state-house yard.
During our stay, our Regiment and the One Hundred
Seventh New York guarded the city.
I took up my quarters with an acquaintance of one
of my Wisconsin friends, and saw to it that his
house and family were not molested. He had
several hundred bales of cotton stored near town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
which Sherman had consented to have bonded;
but some zealous officer or officious "bummer,"
had set fire to it before it could be saved.</p>

<p>Upon our approach to Milledgeville, Governor
Brown of Georgia, had released all of the convicts
in the State Prison at that place. In celebration
of their freedom, their first act was to destroy the
old prison. Our first work was to destroy the
Milledgeville arsenal, in which was stored a large
quantity of Confederate arms and ammunition.
We carried out and threw into the river, all of the
ammunition in the magazine, and burned up all of
the arms and equipment. Besides several thousand
stands of good arms, there were a lot of old-fashioned
rifles and shot-guns, and thousands of
pikes and bowie knives that had been manufactured
by the State for the militia, with which to
repel Yankees. In the state-house were millions
of dollars of Georgia State money, in bills of all
denominations and to these the men helped themselves
without limit. All of the cotton in the vicinity
that could be burned without endangering
good buildings, was destroyed, and that which
was stored in the city was bonded not to be turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
over to the Confederate Government, or used for its
benefit. I was sent out with a detachment of men
to search the stores for tobacco, and found enough
to load several wagons, which kept the army supplied
with that article until we reached Savannah.</p>

<p>From Milledgeville we marched eastward
toward Sandersville, through a very poor country.
At Buffalo Creek, a swampy stream about eight
miles from Sandersville, we found that the seven
bridges crossing it had been burned&mdash;the negroes
told us that this had been done by the people of
Sandersville. We were delayed about three
hours in repairing the bridges, so did not arrive at
Sandersville until the next morning. For the last
two days we had been on slim rations, and Sandersville
was well supplied. Of course there was
a general rush for eatables, and the town was soon
raided. The citizens hurried to Sherman to make
complaint and get protection.</p>

<p>He turned on them and asked, "Which of you
was it who set fire to those bridges yesterday?"
They all denied having done it, but admitted that
it had been done by citizens of the town.
"Well," said he, "those that make war must take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the consequences," which was all the consolation
they got. Later, we found the man who fired the
bridges; he was promptly arrested and his property
burned.</p>

<p>As we entered Sandersville we had a sharp
skirmish with Wheeler's Confederate Cavalry, in
which two of them were killed. Our Indians
seemed to think it was not exactly right to leave
the dead bodies with their scalps on. They soon
fell into the civilized custom of making war, however,
and did not afterward express any desire to
take scalps.</p>

<p>From Sandersville we turned south until we
reached the Georgia Central Railroad at Tennille
Station. We burned the railway buildings there,
and proceeded along the line, tearing it up as we
went along.</p>

<p>On November 28 we passed near the home of
the Honorable Herschel V. Johnson.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> By prodding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
into the ground with their ramrods, some of
our foragers found there a lot of more or less valuable
papers and letters, which had for safe-keeping
been buried in his cabbage patch. Some of
the letters from his son, who was an officer on
Hood's staff, afforded us much amusement. Our
mess forager found here, also, a stock of flour that
lasted until we reached Savannah.</p>

<p>Thus far, we had almost always found sufficient
provisions along the line of march to feed
the command fairly well. Now, however, we
were obliged to send out strong parties of foragers
for long distances on our flanks, to search the country
in order to get enough to eat. Wherever we
went we destroyed everything that might be of
value to the enemy. On the 29th, near Bostwick,
we burned up millions of feet of bridge timber, all
got out and framed for bridges, that the Confederates
expected to build when the Yankees were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
driven out. I noticed that some of the timbers
were marked Strawberry Plains and Chattanooga
Creek.</p>

<p>On December 3 our column crossed the Millen
&amp; Augusta Railroad near Millen, and destroyed
as much of it as we could. We were
now in a level, sandy country, thickly covered
with pine timber, and plantations were few and
scattered. On the 4th we heard cannonading in
the distance, which was said by citizens to be
at Charleston, South Carolina, seventy miles
away. On the 7th we found our road for a distance
obstructed with felled timber, which, however,
so little delayed the march that those in the
rear would not have known of it. On the 8th,
after passing Springfield, the trains and pack-mules
were left behind, with the Third Division
as a guard, while the First and Second Divisions
pushed on rapidly toward Savannah.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>In Front of Savannah</i></h2>


<p>We encountered the enemy in force for the
first time fourteen miles from Savannah, in Monteith
Swamp, where they had built an earthwork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
across the road and felled trees in front of it. The
First Brigade of our Division was sent around to
their left, and our Brigade to their right, while the
Third Brigade moved forward on the center. Our
plan was to hold their attention to the front, while
we got around on their rear. They discovered us
in time, however, to escape. Captain Kleven of
Company H, who with his skirmishers, was in
advance of our Brigade, made a rapid movement
forward as soon as he saw the enemy falling back,
and succeeded in capturing three prisoners. The
First Brigade opened fire at about the same time,
sending a few bullets over our way, and severely
wounding in the foot, Captain Buck of Company
B. The Third Brigade also came up in time to
claim a share in the honor of capturing the three
prisoners. Finally, to settle the dispute, the prisoners
themselves were brought to Division headquarters,
where they pointed out Captain Kleven
as their captor.</p>

<p>At Monteith Station we captured the post-office
and a considerable mail. The letters, which
were mostly written by the soldiers whom we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
had tried to capture the day before, afforded the
men an abundance of fun.</p>

<p>On the 10th we marched to within about four
miles of Savannah, where we were stopped by the
entrenched enemy. While we were getting into
line, a detail of foragers, gathered along the banks
of the Savannah River, spied a small steamer
coming up the stream from the city. They hid
themselves along the shore until the boat was directly
opposite, when they opened a musketry fire
and compelled the craft to surrender. It proved to
be a Confederate dispatch boat on its way up the
river to warn the fleet that Sherman and his army
had arrived. The fleet did not receive the warning,
and interesting developments followed. The
men who had captured the prize did not know its
value, and after stripping it of everything they
wanted, set fire to it.</p>

<p>The country between our lines and those of the
enemy was a big rice plantation, which overflowed
at every high tide, and which could be kept under
water by closing the flood-gates. The only means
of access to the city were the narrow causeways
built through this swamp. At the point where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
were located, the Savannah River is divided by
Argyle Island into two channels, the main or navigable
one being near the Georgia shore. The
island is about ten miles long, and at our end something
like a mile wide. It was occupied by a large
rice plantation, which naturally overflowed
about two feet at high tide, but which had been
ditched and diked so that the flow was regulated
at the flood-gates. If we could control these, we
could keep the island passable. The plantation
buildings were situated on the east side, near the
channel, where a number of acres rose high
enough above the general surface to be safe from
overflow.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 11th our Regiment was
ordered across to Argyle Island. There were on
hand but two or three skiffs, and only a portion of
the men could be brought over that night. In the
morning the crossing was being continued, when
suddenly the discovery was made that three
steamers were coming around the bend of the
river on their way to Savannah. Owing to the
vigilance of our foragers on the previous day, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
had received no warning of the presence of Sherman's
army.</p>

<p>Captain Winegar of Battery M, First New
York Artillery, had his rifled guns in position on
a slight elevation along the shore, where he commanded
the river for a stretch of nearly a mile.
As soon as the steamers, which were a part of
Commodore Tattnall's Mosquito Fleet, came
into plain view, he opened on them. They probably
had never before been under fire for their
crews seemed confused. The first craft, which
was a gunboat, commenced immediately backing
and turning. The second, the armed tender
"Resolute," started to do the same, but was run
into by the third, and so badly crippled that she
drifted ashore against Argyle Island. The other
two vessels managed to escape up the river.</p>

<p>While the miniature naval battle was going on,
our men who were on the island, under command
of Captain Barager, had hastened to the scene.
When the "Resolute" drifted ashore, they were on
hand to prevent the officers and crew from making
their escape in small boats, as they had started to
do. There were twenty prisoners in all. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
afterwards had a fine lot of fun listening to the
officers as they accused one another of being the
cause of the disaster. The "Resolute" was towed
over to the Georgia shore, near the battery, but
could not be repaired in time to be of any service
in our future operations on the island.</p>

<p>The question of rations was at this time becoming
vital. One day's allowance had been issued
to us on the day after our arrival in front of Savannah.
We were, therefore, on the lookout for anything
that might serve to supplement our supplies.
As soon as my Company had come across to the
island, we took the shortest route to the plantation
buildings on the east side. Not a thing was
left; those who had come before us had already
absorbed everything. But at the landing I found
a good six-oared boat that would carry about ten
men besides the rowers. Impressing a crew of
negroes to row the boat, I started for a plantation
on the other side of the river, about half a mile up,
thinking that I would be the first man of Sherman's
army to invade South Carolina. On landing,
however, I was told by the blacks that two of
our "bummers" had been there the day before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and in an altercation with the plantation hands
had killed one of them. The funeral was just
going on when we arrived. Subsequent events
made me believe that Wheeler's Cavalry, and not
our men were responsible for this tragedy.</p>

<p>I placed a sentinel out on the only road by
which a mounted force could approach, and then
began a search for eatables. We soon were rewarded
by a good supply of sweet potatoes and
sorghum. In the boat-house we found a fine lot
of boats; as these were especially valuable for our
purposes, we shoved them all out into the river to
float down to our landing on the island. We had
just loaded up our supplies, when my sentinel came
running in with the report that a large force of cavalry
were coming. We hastily pulled back to the
island and waited for them; but they did not
come to close quarters and soon retired.</p>

<p>Three days later I was sent out with Captain
Barager's Company and my own to take possession
of this plantation. We knew that the
enemy now held it in some force, but we did not
know how strong they were. I had secured boats
enough on our first raid to be able to take over both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of our companies at one time. We started in the
morning, when it was as yet scarcely light, hoping
to come upon the enemy unexpectedly. Their
sentinels discovered us, however, and fired on us
while crossing. We landed about a quarter of a
mile from the plantation buildings and rapidly
pushed forward. I sent Barager with his Company
to the right, while I took the direct course to
the rice mill, in which the enemy were sheltered.</p>

<p>The country was broken up into a mass of
ditches, dykes, and canals. We found that our
only road was along a narrow dyke, and that we
should either have to return or charge them in
single file. We did not retreat. In less time than
it takes to tell this story, we had the mill. They
gave us one volley and hit nobody. We did not
fire a shot. They escaped with their guns and
ammunition, but we captured all their provisions,
including their breakfast cooking on the fire. For
the first time in three days we had all that we
wanted to eat. Colonel Hawley came over soon
after, with three more companies, but toward night
the Confederates appeared in such force that we
again withdrew to the island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>The next morning the enemy brought down a
section of artillery to the Smith Plantation, as it
was called, and commenced shelling our island
camp. I was sent with my Company to get as
close as possible to them on our side of the river,
and either silence them or drive them off. I got
up within about a hundred and fifty yards of
them and opened fire. They immediately turned
their guns on us, and for a few minutes gave it to
us hot. We had good shelter, however, and lost
only one man&mdash;John Furlong, a veteran of Company
E. It took me about twenty minutes to
drive off the battery, but their infantry held out
all day.</p>

<p>On the 19th the whole Brigade crossed over to
the Smith Plantation, with a section of artillery.
Entrenchments were built at all commanding
points, and preparation made to hold the position.
On the 20th Colonel Hawley made a reconnoissance
in force toward Union Causeway, the only
Confederate outlet from Savannah, but found the
enemy in such strength that he could not reach it.
But from our position we could see the lines of
their wagons leaving the city. On the morning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the 21st it was found that the enemy had evacuated
Savannah, and our troops moved in and took
possession.</p>

<p>We now received orders to recross the river to
the Georgia side and march to Savannah. We
had nothing but flatboats to cross in, and a strong
wind was against us, so that we made slow progress
while our Regiment covered the crossing.
When all the rest had passed over, and we were
about half embarked, the enemy swarmed down
upon us by the thousand. They had us surrounded
on three sides, with a river behind; and
our chances for seeing Savannah were not brilliant.
Nevertheless, we faced about and prepared to
fight them. Our friends of the Second Massachusetts
came, without orders, back to our assistance,
and placed themselves where they could
cover our flanks. We were sheltered behind a
dyke, and the enemy could not get at us save by
charging across an open rice field; this they did
not have the nerve to do, so that when darkness
settled down we got off safely to the island. I
think there was not a man in our command, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
thanked his lucky stars that it was not some of
Lee's veterans that had us in that fix that night.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>In Savannah</i></h2>


<p>The next day, we crossed without interruption
from the island to the Georgia shore, which we
reached by four o'clock, and then marched toward
Savannah. We went into camp on the bank of
the river about two miles from the city, and this
ended on our part the "March to the Sea."</p>

<p>Just twenty-five days had elapsed from the time
our army left Atlanta until it signalled the fleet off
the coast. During that time our wing had
marched 300 miles, destroyed over 400 miles of
railroad and an amount of cotton that can hardly
be estimated, and most of the time had lived off the
country. Of our immense train of 2,500 wagons
not one had been captured on the route. We had
moreover secured an almost entirely new stock of
mules and horses. And to crown all, we had
won Savannah with an immense amount of the
spoils of war. It was everywhere the opinion that
Sherman had struck the hardest blow at the Rebellion
that it had yet received, and at the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
cost. The troops were in high spirits over their
continued successes. The feeling prevailed that
they had but to start for a place, and it was theirs.
The confidence in Sherman was unlimited. When
we left Atlanta, on what was considered the most
perilous movement of the war, I never heard a
single expression of doubt as to our ultimate success.
The Confederates whom we encountered
considered him the ablest general that had commanded
troops in the war, and feared him more
than any other.</p>

<p>We remained at Savannah until January 17,
1865. Our camp was in a beautiful grove of live
oaks and pine, festooned with Spanish moss, and
the weather was delightful. The work was comparatively
light, and the men were confidently
looking forward to the end of the war. We
built new fortifications around the city on nearly
the same lines as the old Revolutionary works.
New roads were constructed across Hutchinson
Island and northward into South Carolina. We
were also busy, in order that supplies might be
brought in as fast as needed, in clearing out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Savannah River, which the enemy had closed
with obstructions.</p>

<p>The citizens of Savannah seemed well pleased
with their change of rulers. They uniformly
treated us with courtesy, and displayed a sociability
that we did not usually encounter in the South.
In return, General Sherman showed them every
possible consideration. I was never in a captured
place where private property was respected and
protected as it was here, or where citizens were allowed
so many privileges. Employment was furnished
to those who wanted it, and a large amount
of provisions was placed at the disposal of the
mayor of the city for distribution among the destitute.</p>

<p>A good story was told on the Episcopal rector
of the town. He had been deputized by the rest
of the clergy to wait on General Sherman, and get
permission to preach. When he stated his business,
Sherman at once replied, "Of course you
can preach; that is just what I want you to do."</p>

<p>The preacher then stammered out an enquiry
whether he would be compelled to pray for the
President of the United States. "Pray for Jeff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Davis or the Devil, if you want to," replied Sherman;
"I think you had better pray for them, for
they need it more than Lincoln."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>Marching Northward</i></h2>


<p>On January 17 we crossed the Savannah River
on our bridge of flatboats, and started on our new
campaign to the North. We were at the outset
met by such fearful weather that we were virtually
brought to a standstill. Only a portion of our
army had yet crossed to the South Carolina side,
when a freshet of unprecedented height raised the
river so suddenly that it swept away the bridge,
overflowed Hutchinson Island, and carried off a
lot of wagons and mules that were just about to
start. The freshet came before there had been a
drop of rain in our vicinity; but it began to rain
immediately after, and it seemed as though it
would never stop. The country everywhere became
a perfect quagmire, and a dry spot was hard
to find.</p>

<p>Slowly we proceeded up the east side of
the Savannah River, the remainder of Sherman's
army following on the right side. On the 29th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
at Robertsville, we encountered a strong force of
Wheeler's Cavalry, which delayed our column for
a short time. Our Regiment was sent to the front
to drive them off. The two right companies, under
command of Captain Haskins, deployed as
skirmishers, and soon swept the enemy away like
chaff before the wind. On the 30th we opened
communications with Sherman at Sister's Ferry,
where he had brought the remainder of his army
across into South Carolina.</p>

<p>We now left Savannah River, marching almost
directly north. Profiting by our previous experiences,
we early organized a foraging party of four
men from each company. They had permission
to mount themselves with captured animals as
soon as possible. In a short time they not only had
mounts, but sufficient pack animals to carry several
days' provisions for the Regiment. The first time
they came into camp they presented a motley appearance,
riding horses and mules, and displaying
every variety of saddle and harness known to man.
But they were soon as well mounted as the cavalry,
and had transportation and equipment for
any service. As we marched northward, the enemy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
cavalry became more and more active on our
flanks, so that our foragers were compelled to unite
for protection. Our detail and that from the Second
Massachusetts, under Lieutenant Thompson,
were united almost from the start.</p>

<p>The low ground and the constant rains made
marching so difficult that we rarely covered more
than twelve miles in a day. Much of the way we
were obliged to corduroy the roads for the trains.
For this purpose we used fence rails when they
were to be had; when there were none, we cut
timber and brush. Reaching the Charleston &amp;
Augusta Railroad at Graham Station on February
7, we spent the next four days in destroying
the tracks toward Augusta.</p>

<p>While we were in camp at Graham Station,
Colonel Hawley, who now commanded our
Brigade, and General Slocum, our Corps commander,
had an argument as to the best method of
tearing up a railroad track. Hawley contended
that it was best to line up the men along the track,
and at the word of command have them pick it
up and turn it over. Slocum protested that this
could not be done. A bet was made of a bottle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of Apollinaris water, or something else, and Hawley
sent for his old Regiment to try the experiment.
When the order came to fall in without arms, our
men were cooking their supper. Captain Woodford
of Hawley's staff went along the line, while
we were forming, and explained that the Colonel
had made a bet as to what the Regiment could do.
We were soon lined up along the track, and the
command was given to take hold and lift. In the
hands of those brawny men, that railroad was a
plaything. It went over so fast, that some of the
staff officers who had gathered to watch the performance,
had to move lively to escape the flying
rails and ties.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>From Graham Station we marched northward
through constant rain and mud, subsisting entirely
on the country, without drawing rations except
coffee or sugar, and generally we had plenty to
eat; corn meal and bacon constituted our usual bill
of fare. The army was in fine spirits. In thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
picking up a living in such a country, where the
only products of the soil seemed to be tar and rosin,
and pitch pines the only visible vegetation, they
felt confident of their ability to find a living anywhere.</p>

<p>Our Corps did not enter Columbia, but crossed
the Saluda River about ten miles above. The
Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps of the Army of
the Tennessee occupied the city, and destroyed
everything in it. They released about sixty Union
officers who were confined there; and between them
and the soldiers and the whiskey that was found
Columbia soon ceased to exist. Scarcely a
private residence, even, was left. The only thing
that would not burn was the new state-house, said
to have been the finest in the Union, and this was
mined and blown up. South Carolina was having
a bitter taste of the horrors of war.</p>

<p>On February 21 we struck at Winnsboro the
railroad running between Columbia and Charlotteville;
and following this northward for a distance,
destroyed it as we went along. Then
turning toward the northeast, by way of Rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Mount, Hanging Rock, and Chesterfield, we
marched to Fayetteville, North Carolina.</p>

<p>During the entire march from Columbia to Fayetteville
we had but three pleasant days; the rain
was almost continuous. Our road, most of the
way, was through swamps and creeks, where
bridges had to be built and roads corduroyed.
Frequently, from early morning until midnight, we
worked in rain and mud to get our trains along for
six or eight miles. The rough work soon wore out
our clothing&mdash;many of the men were barefooted;
many were wearing citizen's dress; the whole
army looked more like Falstaff's ragged regiment
than soldiers of the United States. But we met
little opposition from the enemy. The spirit of
four years before seemed to have been beaten out
of them. We felt that the only Confederate troops
that would still give us serious fighting, were those
with Lee at Richmond.</p>

<p>Arriving at Fayetteville on March 12, we once
more opened communication with the fleet, by way
of Wilmington and Cape Fear River. On the
15th we set out on our way to Goldsboro, and
the first night went early into camp, about ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
miles from Fayetteville. At eight o'clock, however,
we were sent out again into a dark and stormy
night to go to the assistance of General Kilpatrick's
Cavalry, which had met the enemy. For
five miles we waded through mud and water to
the place of danger, and bivouacked for the night
in line, facing the enemy. In the morning we had
some sharp skirmishing, but in the afternoon the
enemy were driven from their position.</p>

<p>On the 19th General Carlin's Division of the
Fourteenth Corps was attacked and thrown into
confusion by General Joe Johnston's army near
Bentonville. Our Brigade was rapidly pushed
forward with a number of others, and formed
in line of battle near the left of the Corps.
The enemy made several attacks, the brunt of
which fell upon the troops to the right, and then
retreated. This battle, which the Union Army
nicknamed the Battle of Acorn Run, in compliment
to the badge of the Fourteenth Corps, was
the last in which our Regiment was engaged during
the war.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, we advanced once more, and
found that the enemy was gone. Two days later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
we arrived at Goldsboro, and occupied the city
without opposition. On the 27th, for the first
time since we had left Savannah, rations were issued
to the troops.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>Peace</i></h2>


<p>We began the last campaign of the war on
April 10, entering Raleigh on the 13th without
resistance. The next day we again began to organize
our foraging parties, and to make preparations
for a campaign back through Georgia. During
the day, however, everything was changed.
General Johnston, following Lee's surrender on
April 9, had sent in asking for terms.</p>

<p>On April 20 I wrote home the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="signature1"><span class="smcap">Camp of the 3rd Wis. Vet. Infty.</span></div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Raleigh, N. C., April 20, 1864.</span></div>

<p>My Dear &mdash;&mdash;:
</p>

<p>The Angel of Peace has spread his wings over our
country once more. The glad tidings were announced to
the army last night by General Sherman in general orders.
As soon as the agreement which he had made with General

Washington, peace would be restored from the Potomac
to the Rio Grande. It was a glorious day for us who
have seen the thing through from the beginning to the end.
General Sherman also says that he expects "soon to have
the pleasure of conducting this army to its homes," and I
believe that within six weeks you will see me in Chicago
"home from the wars."</p>

<p>I don't know just exactly what the terms of surrender
are, but it is the opinion of high officers that no troops will
be needed for garrison duty in the South. The rebels
have been so completely whipped that they will never want
to try another rebellion. I understand that Jeff. made no
stipulation for his personal safety, but said he was willing
to take his trial before the courts, and trust to the mercy
of the American people. The only difficulty in the negotiations
was on the question of the confiscation of landed
property, and I have not learned how that was arranged.
But I believe that we have been so completely victorious
that we can afford to be merciful, and that a general
amnesty will do more to cement the Union than the most
rigorous punishment. The punishment that the South has
already endured is like Cain's "greater than they can
bear." The destruction of life in this war in the South
has been terrible.</p>

<p>The news that Johnston had asked for terms on which to
surrender his army was published on the 16th. On the
morning of the 17th a gloom was thrown over the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
army by the announcement of the assassination of the
President, which was reported to have occurred on the
11th. I never saw such a gloomy, sad time since I have
been in the army as that. I don't think we knew how
much we did think of him until then. Many expressed
the opinion that if it had been Andy Johnson and Stanton,
it would not have been much of a calamity. The next
day we had New York papers of the 14th which made no
mention of the murder, and we all thought we had been
hoaxed. Then the explanation was made that the operator
at Morehead City had made an error, and that the
assassination had been on the 14th instead of the 11th, and
now I hardly know what to believe about it. We shall
probably get more news today.</p>

<p>We are about to move our camp, and now for the first
time comfort instead of safety is considered in the selection.
Just think of it! I can hardly realize it. No more skirmishing,
no more digging trenches and building breastworks,
no more whistling bullets, rattling grape-shot, or
screaming shells, no more friends and comrades to be
killed or wounded.</p>

<p>I don't know what has become of all my letters lately.
The mail has come in here three times, and I have not had
a letter. My last letters were dated in February, except
one from * * * of March 7. I suppose they will all
come in a heap one of these days. * * * The weather
is very fine though almost too warm. We have occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
showers, and vegetation is growing fine. This part of
North Carolina is very fine country and crops look well.</p>

<p>A great many of Lee's paroled army are coming in here,
and they seem more pleased at being whipped or at getting
home than we do at having gained a victory. Some
of them say they cheered louder when they surrendered
than Grant's army when they captured them.</p></blockquote>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Our camps were now overrun with citizens and
paroled Confederate soldiers, who were hunting
for horses that they had lost; some of them had
come as far as sixty or seventy miles. We gave
them all the spare horses that we had, for we knew
that the Government would have to help them in
some way to keep them from starvation. We
also issued to them large quantities of rations, for
there was nothing eatable left in all the track of
Sherman's army. On the 29th, general orders
were issued announcing the formal surrender of
Johnston's army.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>Homeward</i></h2>


<p>On the next day began the march to Washington.
We entered Richmond on May 11, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the 15th camped near the old battle-field of Chancellorsville.
On the 24th we marched into
Washington, where the Union army passed in review
before all the dignitaries of our Nation, the
representatives of foreign lands, and the immense
throngs of people who had gathered from far and
near to see Sherman's veterans. For this review,
we selected from our Regiment, eight companies
of thirty-two men each&mdash;the best drilled soldiers
that we had. It was my place to ride in the rear
of the Regiment as it marched down Pennsylvania
Avenue, and no command made a better
show than ours. From the Capitol to the reviewing
stand, the marching and wheeling were simply
perfect.</p>

<p>We now went into camp near Bladensburg,
where all of the men whose terms of service expired
before October 1 were mustered out and sent
home. On June 6, General Hawley issued his
farewell order to the old Brigade. When it was
broken up on the next day, the officers of the Second
Massachusetts sent to the officers of our regiment
the formal expression of the feeling with
which they parted from us. We replied in a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
letter. Even now, after a lapse of twenty-six
years, it stirs the blood to read these two messages.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<p>The Western veteran regiments still had work
before them, and were not mustered out. They
were organized as a provisional Brigade under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Hawley's command, and ordered to Louisville,
Kentucky. Our Regiment left the east on June 11,
travelling by way of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad
to Parkersburg, and then down the Ohio
River to Louisville. Here the Regiment was filled
up with men from other Wisconsin commands, that
were mustered out of service, until we had about
1,500 on our muster rolls. It was rumored, and
in fact intended, that we should go to Mexico to
drive out the French. The programme was entirely
changed, however, when news came of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
voluntary withdrawal of the French soldiers, and
orders were issued to muster out our Regiment.</p>

<p>A considerable number of our old veterans did
not want to go home. A company was made up
of those who wished to enter the services of the
Juarez government in Mexico&mdash;at least they
wished to go, if I would go in command. I was not
quite ready, however, to become a soldier of fortune.
When our duty to the Federal Government
had been accomplished, I was as anxious as any
to be mustered out of the army of war, and return
to the army of peace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span></p>

<blockquote><div class="signature2">Second Massachusetts Infantry,</div>
<div class="signature1">Camp Slocum, Washington, D. C,</div>
<div class="signature2">June 4, 1865.</div>

<p>We, the undersigned, officers of the Second Massachusetts Infantry, wish to express
to the officers of the Third Wisconsin Infantry our heartfelt regret that the
fortunes of the service are about to separate our respective organizations.
</p>

<p>From the campaign of 1862, in the Shenandoah Valley to the present glorious
close of this bloody war, we have fought and marched side by side with you in
almost every rebellious state. To have been brigaded together for so long a time
is in itself remarkable; no less so is it that between our two regiments there should
always have existed such strong feelings of friendship and mutual regard, untinged
by the slightest shadow of jealousy.
</p><p>
As we recall now, some of the hard positions we have been in, we cannot help
remembering how often our anxiety was lessened by the knowledge that the old
Third Wisconsin was close at hand to support us. We know that you have had
the same thoughts about us. Nothing in this whole war will be pleasanter for us
to look back upon than this feeling of mutual respect and reliance. It not only
elevated the tone of both our regiments, but we honestly believe, it went a great
way toward making our brigade and division what they are now acknowledged to
be&mdash;among the very best organizations of the army.
</p><p>
We assure you that in our own State, wherever the Second Massachusetts is
known, its brother regiment is also famous. Whenever any of us have been at
home, among the first inquiries would be, "How is the Third Wisconsin?" It
has been with pride that we have answered, "It is the same staunch old regiment
that fought at Antietam and Chancellorsville."
</p><p>
These are not compliments but expressions of plain, honest feelings. We have
been knit together by deeds not words; deeds, which, as time goes on, we shall look
back upon with continually increasing pride.
</p><p>
Together we have shared dangers and hardships, victories and defeats; and it is
hard now for us to part; but in the natural order of things, the war being over, you
go towards your homes in the west, we stay near ours in the east. Let us not,
however, though separated by thousands of miles, forget these old associations. Let
us rather cherish them with the fondest recollections: let it be a story to hand down
to our children and children's children, how the Second Massachusetts and Third
Wisconsin fought shoulder to shoulder through the great rebellion, and achieved
together glory and renown. We ask you to accept this testimonial as a slight evidence
of our affection and esteem. We bid you farewell, and God bless you, one
and all,
</p>

<div class="signature">Camp Slocum, near Washington, D. C.</div>
<div class="signature2">June 7, 1865.</div>

<p> To the officers of the Second Massachusetts Veteran Volunteer Infantry:</p>

<p>The undersigned, officers of the Third Wisconsin Veteran Volunteer Infantry,
tender their heartfelt thanks for your friendly communication of the 4th inst. It
was with mingled feelings of pride and pleasure, not, however, unmixed with pain,
that we perused it&mdash;pride at being thus associated with a regiment, which by patient
endurance, good discipline, and unflinching bravery, has won for itself so honorable
a name as the Second Massachusetts; pleasure at the thought that, even
amid the stirring scenes of active war, the finer attributes of humanity are not forgotten,
and that friendship, one of the noblest sentiments of the soul, still asserts
her claims; pain at the recollection of the many gallant and brave, whose names
have been associated with yours in the great struggle now happily terminated, but
who have given their lives for a country they loved so well.
</p><p>
That "every rose has its thorn" was never more apparent to us than now. While
in the toil and suffering of our active campaigns, we have looked forward with unmixed
joy to the time when the angel of peace should once more spread her wings
over the land, and we should return home to enjoy the sweets of social and civil
life, but now that the hour is at hand when we must say farewell to those with
whom we have been associated in the service of our common country, when we
must join the parting hand with you, our companions and brothers in arms, our joy
is mingled with sadness and our smiles with tears.
</p><p>
We accept your communication, not only as a manifestation of personal regard,
but also as a fraternal greeting from the east to the west, which rising superior to
local jealousies and factional strife, and remembering only the mingled dust of our
dead on many battlefields, and the common country for which they sacrificed their
all, proclaims us, in heart and in country, one and inseparable.
</p><p>
In parting, we assure you that, highly as we prize this expression of sentiment
toward us, and sacredly as we will preserve it as the highest honor yet received, it
is not needed to secure remembrance. The ineffaceable pictures of the past deeply
engraven in our hearts, and lit up by the eternal flame of friendship will ever keep
the Second Massachusetts Veteran Volunteer Infantry prominent among our pleasing
memories in the future.
</p>

<p>
Wishing you all success and happiness and Heaven's best blessing, we bid you
farewell. We are, brothers, yours fraternally,
</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
